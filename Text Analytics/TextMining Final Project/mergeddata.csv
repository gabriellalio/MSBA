review
"adidas For the longest time, I had mixed emotions regarding sneakers. Too often, I really disliked the neon colors even if they were supportive. Regular ""fashion sneakers"" would be too cheap or flimsy to wear regularly. And even though I still remain a fan of shoes like Converse, I needed a pair of sneakers that had the arch support I needed that also didn't clash with what I was wearing.<br/><br/>I looked around for a bit online and eventually settled upon these, especially since the asking price was very reasonable. After a bit of hemming and hawing concerning what size world be best (since there are not really any posted women's sizes) I took the plunge.<br/><br/>And I'm so glad I did! These sneakers are fantastic, and look good with virtually any everyday outfit I can put together. The narrow fit looks really flattering and the oversized tongue gives it some extra flair. After a week or so any issues I was having with how they felt vanished when they were broken in. Just about the only problem I've been having is that I'm wearing them almost every day! üòÖ<br/><br/>Luckily they're very easy to clean (and it was a good move to make the sole out of a material that wasn't white) but I'm planning on getting the black pair soon so I don't run these into the ground right away. Still, I'd recommend these to anyone who wants a great pair of sneakers for work or fashion."
"adidas These have been my favorite all purpose adventure and bike riding shoes, at least when conditions don't call for hiking boots.<br/><br/>I find the fit to be a bit narrow, but I can wear them all day with no problems.<br/><br/>The hard soles and lack of cushioning may be a problem for others, but it's my favorite feature of these shoes. That and the odd amount of water resistance they have.<br/><br/>For the price and overall functionality of these, you can't go wrong."
"adidas I wore Sambas in my late teens (I'm now 39 years old).  I'm convinced that either my feet didn't matter to me as much back then (I also lived in Doc Marten's year-round and in any weather conditions, so I was probably just ""tougher"" back then :P )....or that they have SEVERELY changed the insole in these shoes over the years.  I don't recall having any gripes with them back then.<br/><br/> I bought a pair at an Adidas outlet several years back.  Tried them on, and although the arch-support felt awfully ""high"" and stiff to me...I didn't think much of it.  I figured I'd get used to them in time.  Wore them the whole next day, and when I got home...I literally felt like my instep was bruised.  I seriously threw the shoes in the trash that night because I was so irritated with them.<br/><br/>Flash-forward to about 2 weeks ago.  I thought about getting another pair of Sambas...but even at a sub-$40 price-point...I couldn't really justify buying another pair of shoes just to throw them in the trash again....so I did a little research.  I figured I couldn't possibly be the only person to think that these shoes were unfathomably uncomfortable. Almost torturously so.  So I googled something like ""uncomfortable Samba insoles"" or something of the sort...and stumbled upon a true godsend.  Some ingenious and benevolent soul uploaded a YouTube video that addressed my exact concern.  Come to find out...the Samba insoles are VERY easy to remove.  When you do so and flip them over...there is a white rubber piece that is attached with an easily removable adhesive that you can peel the entire arch-support off with literally no effort.  Slip the insoles back in, and BOOM....comfortable Sambas.  I will admit that even with the ridiculous arch-support removed, there is still a little more arch than I would prefer due to the shape of the shoe in general (I prefer my insoles virtually flat)...but it's the difference between having a pair of shoes I can wear every day...and having a pair of shoes that would go immediately in the trash.  If my above description of how to perform minor surgery on your Sambas is confusing, Google ""How to remove samba insole"" video....it'll be the first thing that comes up in YouTube.  It seriously couldn't have been a quicker or easier fix.  Without this ""hack""...these shoes would be a negative 15 in terms of any kind of comfort unless you like your shoes with a ridiculous amount of stiff arch-support.  Hopefully this review will help someone else that had the same issue as me, because for the price I bought them for (again...I got them for a little under $40) I doubt you'll find a better value on a name-brand shoe...as long as you can comfortably wear them."
"adidas Adidas is always a little bit roomier than Nike.  So MAYBE you can go down just half a size.  But mainly these bad boys are true to fit.  And they feel incredible.  Played my first match in them 3 days ago, laces stayed tied up easily.  They have a great touch on the ball. Good grip on the floor. And I've also been wearing them regularly for just walking around or biking.  You CANNOT go wrong with a pair of Samba Classics.  These shoes have been around for DECADES for a reason people.  Buy them. Joga bonito."
"adidas Delivery took a couple days longer than the 2-day prime shipping selected, and at first glance, they look kind of cheap. Mostly because of the texture of the tongue, but then again, I'm not familiar with the standard soccer shoe materials. However, after trying them on, they felt pretty darn good! I'm really digging the gum sole! I thought the long tongue was going to be off-putting but it's actually pretty cool when worn outside the jeans! I got the white version and it looks absolutely pristine! So far so good! Now to see how they are when tested with regular use, dancing, the elements, and time!"
"adidas My teenage son is addicted to Samba's. For 4 or 5 years running now these are the only shoes he wears for daily use. I don't honestly know if it the looks or the comfort but he just loves them. Just bought a new pair and he opened them for Christmas yesterday and was SO happy to get a new pair! He wears them for everyday use, not for running. These have little arch support so he wears running shoes for running and sports that involve running. Shoes last him from 1 to 1.5 years and do not fall apart quickly or easily. These used to be available in stores on our area but not anymore, can only find them on Amazon. He is currently training to be a chef, works long hours in a kitchen and these provide adequate comfort - he won't wear anything else. Hope Adidas keeps making them."
"adidas I didn‚Äôt look carefully enough at the picture of the sneakers.  Look carefully at it yourself, and heed this warning: the tongue of the sneakers is ridiculously long!  It comes way up the front of the sneaker, and rubs against the front of your ankle as you move.  This is especially annoying during summer months, when wearing low ‚Äúankle socks,‚Äù as it‚Äôs rubbing against bare skin!  I don't know if this is some kind of ""style"" young people are into or what (like low pants that show your boxers), but I don't like it.  I‚Äôve folded the tongue over and tied the lace across the top of the fold, to hold it down and keep it from rubbing against my ankle.  This is a solution, but affects the ‚Äúlook‚Äù of your kicks.  Otherwise, I LOVE Adidas Samba sneakers; this is my fourth pair, and the others I‚Äôve bought had regular-sized tongues."
"adidas Buying shoes on line can be tricky these were too big for my son but as he's growing and was just 13 we kept them and he grew into them. They are great because they are leather uppers and so his feet don't stink so much even if he wears them everyday for a week ... which he does. His large feet eat through most sports sneaker in 3 months, some top brands in less. but these are the first he's ever grown out of leaving them with the leather top intact and good wear left on the soles after 5 months of wear.. AMAZING ... pity they don't make a size 14 for men."
"adidas I've worn Sambas much throughout my youth and have always loved the style of the Samba shoe. Adidas have always run a little smaller than my actual size.<br/><br/>Now, I typically wear a size 10.5 men's, so I ordered a size 11. The fit is perfect, however the shoe is a little tight near the toes (not uncomfortable, just tight), but after having worn them for a few weeks they've broken in and aren't as tight as when I first got them.<br/><br/>One thing, as I have aged I no longer need arch support. In fact the arch support ends up hurting my feet and sends a sharp stinging pain from my big toe into my heel. The Sambas have a foam wedge glued inside the shoe attached to the liner for arch support. After a few days of wearing the Sambas I started feeling the pain I described above. I immediately ripped the foam arch support from inside the shoe. Since then the pain as gone and these shoes are comfortable again.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the arch support, I hate having to perform surgery on my shoes to make them comfortable- but since it's an easy fix, 4 stars."
"adidas These are a pretty narrow shoe--at least compared to how my other shoes fit (since that makes the Adidas a bit of an outlier in my experience, 4 stars instead of 5). Also, in some shoes I can get by with a men's 13.5, but with these I need a size 14. But the shoes themselves are nicely made, with a certain classic look. I rate them on the high end, but would advise wide-footed folks to try 'em inside a bit (not wear them outside) in order to see if you'll need to return them. I sent back the 13.5 pair and ordered a size 14, so no complaints about the design/etc. of the shoe itself."
"adidas I am on my third pair of Sambas in a row and couldn't be happier with these shoes. They are comfortable, they breath well, and they look awesome. My first pair were the Samba Classics, and I loved them. Comfortable, durable, and just all around a much better fit than the skate shoes I had worn before. These are shoes I can walk for 10 hours a day and not worry about a thing on. However I managed to get plastic calking all over them and basically ruined the shoe, so I moved onto Samba Dragons. They are more low profile, and the front treads are slightly thinner than the back. But I have worn the treads off them in the last two and a half years, and the trim is suede. I needed a good looking pair of stage shoes for my band and I thought what a better time. I know these will hold up and look good, especially if I take good care of them. I still plan to use the dragons at work because you really just cant kill these shoes!!!"
"adidas I have purchased Adidas Sambas as my primary footwear since 2004. (That's 12 years). They are wonderful. Definitely worth the price. I am a woman with size 11 feet so I buy the men's size 9. They fit perfectly. I normally order women's shoes wide but these are wide enough without needing to order wide. Each pair lasts about 3 or 4 years. I buy a new pair when the old when get slippery on the bottom. After prolonged use, the ""grippy"" texture on the bottom begins to wear away and, eventually, becomes slippery. I've never had a pair of Sambas wear out like other shoes that I have purchased. Sambas do not come apart from the sole/get holes in the bottoms. I do not play sports so I cannot comment on what these shoes are like for playing indoor soccer, et cetera. I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone looking for excellent footwear."
"adidas After reading different reviews about the Samba Classics regarding a larger tongue and arch support, I was a bit hesitant to get them.<br/>After some debate I bought the shoes and like many people say, the arch support may take some getting used to (although if you really can't stand it, there are tutorials online on how to remove it). The longer tongue also wasn't an issue and easily tucks in if its not your thing. You may even be able to cut it to size.<br/>My only complaint is that the shoes were slightly larger than I expected. I believe I have an average foot and wear a size 10 in most other shoes. However, the Samba Classics were just a bit large on me. Hardly noticeable but its something to consider."
"adidas This is my favorite style of Adidas sneakers. I live in NYC and I am over the Stan Smith style which is very pedestrian . This sneaker is very comfortable and easy to break in after a few wearings . Yes the extended tongue on the Classic Samba may be a little long for some, but it<br/>looks so cool if you bend it forward towrds the front. Funny that people always comment on these sneaker and they are a classic style from Adidas."
adidas What the heck Adidas? My six year old beaten up Sambas are much more comfortable than a pair that I purchased this month! Why make the toe box smaller?! The shoe was absolutely perfect before but now they are uncomfortable to wear. The fabric by the toe bends into a sharp point and it is kind of painful. I am pretty disappointed actually. I am not the only one who has these complaints either! Plenty of people have been experiencing the same distress. Adidas listen to your customers for goodness sake!
adidas I'd been wanting a white pair of sambas for a while. Been wearing these shoes since around 1994ish... so I knew they'd be durable. And they'd break in. Only issue with the shoes are they start a little snug and narrow for my feet. They fit well. But need a good breaking in before they're comfortable. Which is why I think they run just a little smaller than expected regardless. They're Fantastic and the white really sets them apart from normal adidas samba shoes!
adidas Classic
adidas A simple and classic pair of shoes for soccer. I would recommend this as a starter pair of shoes when it comes down to playing indoor soccer or futsal for the first time. It is a little heavier than your current shoes on the market but this shoe speaks a universal language that everybody understands. It represent soccer and a nice simple look with many outfits. I recommend this to everybody.
"adidas I've been wearing Adidas brand shoes for quite some time and have had the fit dialed in perfectly.  Going all the way back to 1998 I've been a solid size 10M.  The last pair of Samba's I purchased were a size 10M and fit like a glove.  This was back in 2010.  After five years of weekend use it was time to replace the trusty Samba's with a shiny new pair and so I ordered up a size 10M via Amazon Prime.  Upon arrival, a test fit ensued and ""What's this?!""  The sizing has clearly changed since 2010.  Sure, it's possible my feet may have changed a bit in that period of time (getting older, you know...) but it was night and day compared to my last pair.  I boxed them up for a return/exchange and had a size 10.5M sent along.<br/>When the 10.5M's arrived, another test fit ensued and...something still isn't quite right.  The length of the left shoe feels a little too long and the width is a little too tight whereas on the right the width is just right and length seems just a tiny bit too long.  My feet aren't that messed up!<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, a little wear/walking time with them breaks down the stiffness of the leather and allows for a better fit.  Unfortunately, I'm finding these are just a hair too big.  Every so often I'll catch the left toe and get that ""Clown Shoe"" feeling.  Problem is, the 10M's were so uncomfortably tight in both length and width that I don't imagine I could've walked my way into breaking them in.  Too long, too tight, something has changed in the sizing of these shoes over the years.<br/><br/>Bottom Line<br/>We all love the classic styling of the Samba's and we know we're going to get them regardless.  To make your experience better, order a half size bigger than you'd normally wear in an Adidas shoe if you haven't purchased these in the past few years.  See how they fit and know that they will break in and become more comfortable in a short period of time.  The primary concern should be with the length and width.  Make sure you get those dialed in and let your walking break in the rest of the way to comfort.<br/><br/>4 Stars - I love 'em but wish they fit like they always used to"
"adidas Adidas shoes seem to run a little small overall as compared to other street shoes that I have.  I normally wear a size 12 in street shoes.  A size 12 in adidas shoes, any adidas I have ever tried, is too small.  I usually end up getting a 13 which is just a little too big.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I could order a 12.5 and it fits perfectly!  Thank you Amazon!"
adidas I'm a Samba guy and I decided to spice it up with some white ones. With a price of $44 I had to take a chance. They arrived in two days and they are fantastic. They fit just like my black ones and arrived in an authentic Adidas box. They are the real deal and not knock offs. I would order from this person again without hesitation!
"adidas Bought these for weight lifting. I needed a firm sneaker with very little compression under heavy load. These were perfect!<br/><br/>They are very slightly smaller than most sneakers I buy in the same size, but not unwearably small.<br/><br/>I would point out that the arches are pretty aggressively firm, to the point it is actually a bit uncomfortable for a while. This must be a fairly recent change, as old Sambas did not have this. It breaks in after a while. If it really bothers you, you can peel the arches out of the sole inserts- no big deal.<br/><br/>Great for what I'm using them for and very sturdy!"
"adidas I may have forgotten how much 'break-in' these require, but these seem narrow compared to the Sambas they are replacing. They have grown more comfortable over the last couple weeks, but they are certainly needing some stretching. If you have wide feet, you may want to reconsider. I ordered the same size Sambas I was wearing, but these seem different. The construction seems fine, just the fit is off. I will continue to break them in to see if they can last like the previous pair."
"adidas Best shoes ever. Definitely buying again. There is a hole on the right foot that I can push my pinky toe out of, but that only happened after 6 months of use *every day*. I wore this when just walking around, and for a 30-day streak of playing at least an hour of soccer outdoors every day (didn't have cleats), and then traveling, and a little running when I didn't have running shoes (probably wouldn't recommend that too much). (and you should wash them. they absorb all that dirt haha) The hole may be fixable but it's in an awkward position; I will buy a new pair anyway. Incredibly comfortable.<br/><br/>If you're in between sizes, opt for the smaller size or the half-size. I typically wear 13 but can fit into 12 depending on the brand. Got these in 13, slightly too much wiggle room and I have to tie the laces very tight. If you get a smaller fit, it will conform to your foot.<br/><br/>10/10 Sambas ftw (these are the NON-squeaky ones :) )"
"adidas These shoes look very cool and the fit is kind of okay.<br/><br/>I only wear them with long socks, because the tongue is super long. If you can see in the picture, it almost touches the back of the shoe. When you put your foot in, the tongue goes about a few inches up on your leg. If you wear them without long socks, it will rub all of the leg hair off the bottom of your shin.<br/><br/>These shoes are the coolest shoes Adidas offers, but they are a little uncomfortable because the arch is somewhat big. To make these somewhat comfortable, you will have to break them in, tear out the little foam inserts they have, and just give your feet some relaxation time by not wearing them every day.<br/><br/>They are a really cool shoe to add if you have a pair of shoes that you are already comfortable with. But I wouldn't make these your only pair of shoes.<br/><br/>Again I strongly recommend buying these as a second pair or something, and just be prepared to break them in."
"adidas I bough these shoes because they fit in my bike pedal straps. This is pair number two. The last pair lasted almost 18 years. When I ride it can be from 1 hour work out to 8 hours a day for a week on a trip. I can ride all day and then use them to walk around town at night with no problems. These shoes are thin (not bulky) and comfortable. When I wear this pair out I hope they are still making them. I have seen some reviews that say that they are not as good as they use to be but, I don't see it. If they only last half as long as my first pair OMG I will have to replace them in 9 years. Too be fair these are my biking shoes and not for everyday use. However I bike a lot. Note: I ride a three wheeler with power strap pedals clip on shoes are not right for me. These shoes work great if want or need a low profile shoe."
"adidas This shoe is perfect. I had a couple of adidas Samba Original in the past and it has been my everyday shoe. Looking for a new pair I saw this classic fit here in amazon and started to search some reviews on youtube to see how them fit. Most people didn't complain at all, the fit was prefect and the shoe had the same feeling as the originals but the main difference was that the tongue was a bit larger. Other people said that it was a bit more fired than the originals.<br/><br/>I decided to give them a try anyway and it was the best decision ever. To me this fit better than the classic because they are more compact and feel a bit more natural. Also the tongue is not a problem at all. If you use socks bigger than quarter long you won't even feel them. In fact the make the shoe feel more stylish and look better."
"adidas I love these shoes. I have wanted a pair for years. I saw them at the store but could not afford them. One drunken night sifting through Amazon for something I actually needed, I said screw it! Looked up sambas. You had them for 20 bucks less that the sporting goods stores. But... That lead to an avalanche of spending money I did not have. I ended up with a 12 foot bullwhip, and a Halloween costume. Don't drink and shop, friends.<br/>But the shoes fit perf3ct and the arch support is great."
"adidas I learned at one point that there are two types of Sambas.  These ones and the version with the blue label on the outside of the tongue.  Both fit fine, but there is something about the ones with the blue label that make them squeak with every footstep.  It was not ideal.<br/><br/>But these ones are great!"
"adidas These shoes are amazing! They basically formed to my foot after a day. They are great looking and appear high quality in design and build. For some reason, with these shoes I can juggle better and with more control. I can control my direction of strike way better and the dense circle under the joint of my big toe gives more weight behind my strike so I can kick farther. The grip on these things is amazing; indoors I can maneuver the ball in  ways I never could with regular shoes. I can wear these to swim practice every day and go out and play after without changing shoes. All around perfect football/soccer shoes, will definitely buy another pair if they wear out, but I don't see these well-built things getting tore up easy. A must buy for any indoor player, casual soccer player and even beginners."
"adidas I just purchased my 4th pair of these. I bought my first pair in 2008 which makes the average life expectancy (for me at least) around 3 years or more. Sambas are the only shoe I wear anymore.<br/><br/>At first they can be a bit stiff and snug, but once they break in they fit like a glove."
"adidas Great, comfortable, classic shoes.  I've bought 3 pairs, and the first two each lasted me over 3 years of daily, all purpose wear.  This includes wet winter weather, occasional running (note: these are not great for running on concrete, as there's little cushion, but you can do it), frequent dancing, workouts, bike rides and of course, indoor soccer.<br/><br/>The leather holds up well to all sorts of abuse.  The gum-sole does wear out eventually, but not for a long while, and is of course non marking.  The fit is on the &lt;i&gt;slightly&lt;/i&gt; smaller side of true to size, and have just a bit of instep support.<br/><br/>I really can't think of a better shoe for the price.  I've worn similar looking Asics, Onitsukas, and Nikes in the past, but none fit quite like the Adidas Sambas.  I can't see myself ever buying another athletic shoe."
"adidas Glad I got this on Amazon, hopefully I'll be able to reorder in a few years when it's time for a new pair.  I wear dress shoes at least 5 days a week so I rarely wear these.  The quality is great, as expected.  They look way better than the picture, and there is TONS of arch support.  If you don't like arch support, then this shoe is not for you.  It took me a while to get used to it even, but now if my feet are sore I just wear these for a day and feel great the next day.  Really, tremendous arch support.  Great looking shoe!"
"adidas These are somewhat different than my last Samba Classics from about 8 years ago.<br/><br/>They seem to be narrower and maybe slightly longer? Where the others got snuggly and flattened down really fast, these flop off my feet as if they are too big. I cannot get comfy in them. Tightening the laces doesn't work to stop my foot from lifting up. Getting out of them is even easier than before though."
adidas Looking good
"adidas Reddit /r/buyitforlife/ suggests these are some tough shoes that will last for a long time. Mine started to wear and break on the inside, the inside material clearly feels cheap and unreliable. I just used them to go to the office and back, no intense use. So I conclude that I got a pair of fakes - waste of money. I suggest you buy them from a reliable shop, this adidas shop on amazon sells fakes (or maybe you are luckier)."
"adidas I know. It's a cardinal sin not to like Converse All Stars. I just don't like the ubiquitous, ""bubble gums,"" but I wanted a sneaker I could wear everything from shorts to casual, sporty, summer suits. I didn't want some bright shiny neon thing, but I didn't want something as low key as Ralph Lauren Polo canvas shoes either.<br/><br/>Enter Adidas Samba Classics. A timeless, versatile shoe, without the hipster or preppy connotations of Chucks or Ralphs. Unlike the 'updated' Samba Originals, the Classics don't squeak.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the arch support. It is huge. I have a mild arch and it's just too much. The shoe is so narrow and arch so prominent that I feel bound, even when I tried a larger size. If you need/want humongous arch support, you should know that the only reason I deducted a star is because of it. Arch supports are fine, but I don't need to walk on Annapurna, for Christ's sake.<br/><br/>Other than that, these shoes are a winner. I'm going to need a pair in white. ...I can just feel it. Maybe the Milleniums don't have such a prominent arch."
"adidas I bought them for my husband, and always buys size 9 from Adidas but for this samba they run a little smaller. My husband said they were tight on the sides, but after a couple of days he noticed they were short too, kind of pinching his big toe. He'll get half size up because he really likes this shoes anyway."
"adidas i ordered the wrong size, but the shoe is great. It was suggested that I wear a 6.5 for a women's 8, but it was still too large. After trying a kids size 6, the shoe fits, but the longer tongue in the men's shoe was cut in half for the kids and rubs my ankle the wrong way. If you're looking for sizing, kids starting from 1 runs all the way to the largest men's size. Kids size ends at 6 and men's starts at 6.5."
adidas I use these for playing table tennis.  This is my second pair.  I have recommends this to others and they like this shoe to.<br/>What is important is that the sole is ONE piece.  The Somoa look like the Samba but it has a glued on sole that come off and can't be glued on.
"adidas I used to be regular user of Sambas, buying them time and again. After a few years' break, I decided to return because I had always liked the style and comfort. Unfortunately, the shoes have changed. Now, they are far too narrow at the front area around the toes. They are even rather narrow for using in indoor soccer, but for regular day-to-day wear, they are intolerably narrow and I had to return them. It's unfortunate, because the style remains great, but the sizing is just too bad. I'd also add that the arch is a bit excessively large, but that wasn't critical in my decision to return these to the seller."
"adidas I've been wearing the same pair almost daily for over two years now and am just now considering replacing them. I have not been easy on them. I've taken them on many 3-5 mile runs, powerlifted, and completed many, many manual labor tasks in them. And, of course, all the usual walking around. 100/100 for durability. One thing to note, these were almost a non-starter for me when I first got them, I was getting a ridiculous pain in my inner arch whenever I wore them. I found in the Amazon reviews people saying to tear out the arch support from the sole. I did so and they were a perfect fit."
"adidas Remember, there is a difference between the ""Classic"" shoe and the ""Originals"".  The originals have a less athletic fit, and are made more for everyday use.  The Classic Samba, which is this one, is the original soccer shoe that Adidas has been making for decades.  IMHO, this is the one to buy if you plan on playing soccer (or any other sport).  The Originals fit a little differently, and don't feel as supportive from an athletic standpoint.  This is probably why the adidas website lists the Classic Samba under ""Men's Soccer"", while they list the Originals Samba under ""Men's Originals"".<br/><br/>Either way, I use this shoe for indoor soccer and they work great. Have been using them for years and each pair lasts 3-4 years depending on how much playing I am able to do.  Work well for frozen fields and short-grass turf fields as well.  I hope they never change this design.  I wear an 11M in mens, which is my size in all Adidas and Asics shoes."
"adidas I LOVE classic sambas. They are a durable shoe with good build quality and comfort. I usually leave them loosely tied and treat them as slip-ons. However, when needed, I can tighten them up and play soccer with no issues.  These are my go to shoe 3 seasons out of the year (not in winter!). They tend to loosen a bit and the fit improves after a few weeks of wear as you break in the leather. The arches can feel a bit high to some people, but I have high arches on my feet, so the support is welcome.<br/><br/>I generally have to buy a pair every 2 years because I quite literally walk a hole in the sole of the shoe. The sole is relatively soft, and the shoes may last a bit longer with a more solid sole. That said, I like the sole because it permits me to feel under my feet quite well compared to many other shoes."
"adidas Love Sambas! This is my fifth pair. I got the white ones this time to change it up. Took a little bit (less than half a day) to get used to the arch support, but I love them just as much as my other Sambas. I'm usually a size 11 to 11.5 depending on brand and I've found with Adidas I usually, if not always, need to go with 11.5. Did that with these and they fit perfectly. I only paid a little over $30 for this pair and they're authentic and look awesome! With my Prime shipping the shoes arrived in two days. Very satisfied with my purchase."
"adidas Ordered these Classic for my son along with the Originals. He tried both pairs on and liked these Classic better for the soles are slightly thicker and the front of the shoes are slightly squarer and sturdier (he did the Michael Jackson tippy toe stand) as compared to the Originals EXCEPT the tongue are long and poked onto the front of his ankles. It bothered him, so he chose the Originals. I am writing a review on the Originals if you want to check it out. Otherwise, both the Classic and the Originals are about the same with a slight price difference (as of now). No problem returning with Amazon."
"adidas When I joined an indoor soccer team, I needed soccer shoes, and these came highly recommended (I had been wearing the¬†<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Superstar-2Gs/dp/B0007QCPPK"">Superstar 2Gs</a>¬†as my ""everyday"" shoe for over a decade, which are comfortable but not a great choice for soccer.) Well, it took a couple days to get used to the way this shoe felt, but once I did, I honestly have to say that not only is it great for soccer, but it is even more comfortable than the Superstar 2Gs to wear as an everyday shoe.<br/><br/>I was so impressed by how comfortable this shoe was that after owning it for a mere week, I bought a second pair of Sambas in black so that I would have it in both colors. I don't think I am going back to any other sneaker -- this is definitely the most comfortable shoe I have ever personally worn, and that's good enough for me.<br/><br/>I will note that the shoe laces are on the short side, and I have considered getting longer ones, but I have made due with the ones that it came with so far. Other than that, I have had no problem with this shoe and I hope that adidas keeps making them so that I can keep buying them."
"adidas They run a little tight/narrow, but stretch out soon to fit you.  I'm an ER doctor on my feet all day.  They are my work moccasins for 12 years now.  When one pair wears out I get another.  I beat these silly, 5 days a week, for 12 hour days, and after about 2 years replace them as they get scuffed up over time.  I'm about due again.  Nice flat sole.  Please, please, please never change these.  I'm sure they work for soccer, but also great for a minimalist sneaker-moc."
"adidas These are the classic samba indoor soccer shoe.  They are well known - famous - infamous.  Although, I love them and can wear them all day, some people will not like the lack of arch support.  They are somewhat flat in the arch department, as far as the build of the shoe--not completely flat but not as much arch support as running shoe.  These shoes are not built like a running/jogging shoe - not like an ASICS or whatever,  You can still run in these, but they feel more like running used to feel before the running shoes of today.  These shoes are a great in-between shoe -- in between bare foot running shoes (5 toed shoes) and ASICS running shoes."
"adidas I originally bought these back in 2004 and used them for playing drums, and loved them so much I bought 3 more pairs. Unfortunately I lost them in a move 4-5 years ago, went back to the Big 5 Sporting goods store where I purchased them last month only to find out they no longer sell them. Decided to ive amazon.com a try and low and behold there they were. Once ordered I was expecting to wait 24 day for delivery and would have happily done so (Samba's have exceptional comfort for a sport shoe not used personally for sports) However The shoes came with in 10 days or order, a shock to my wife and I :-) (I was wearing these shoes when I asked her to marry me ;-)she said yes haha) same great fit and comfort I loved a decade ago. Please keep producing these amazing shoes for I am a life long customer."
"adidas Second time I bought a pair of these bad boys. I have bought a lot of sneakers in my day ranging from Nike, to Puma, to Converse, newbalance, etc. but never have I enjoyed a pair as much as the Sambas. They look great and last really long, had a pair for over a year in college which I then brought to China traveling for 3 months, then coming back to the states and currently using them as deadlift, squat and military pressing shoes. And over here in the New England weather, its hot then cold, then rain then snow so these shoes have held up tremendously. Note, the shoe has NO arch support, but that is a problem that can be easily solved. Also, the shoe runs a bit narrow so that may be a turn off but you can always purchase a size up."
adidas If you are a women purchasing these shoes please make sure you go two sizes down...for the conversion from women to men size. For example in women sneakers I wear size 7.5 but when I purchase men sneakers I have to get a size 6 or 6.5. I do recommend going one size up for instance I would have to get size 6 originally but for comfort I ordered 6.5. These shoes are stylish and comfortable when the correct size is chosen.
"adidas I got it because it was cheap and I had been going through 2-3 running shoes a year and didn't want to pay the stupid premium for ""women's shoes"".  However, there is little in the way of padding, and as is typical for Adidas, they run on the narrow side.  They're so thin, I can't add more padding to offset the problem.<br/><br/>I always order shoes based off of their EU size because they always fit.<br/><br/>Or they did.  If only they were a bit wider and didn't leave me limping after 2km from lack of padding in the soles and rubbing my pinkie raw.  Was the correct length however!<br/><br/>They seem okay wandering about the neighbourhood, though.<br/><br/>Will have to order real running shoes."
adidas Took a little while longer to break in than previous sets of Sambas I have owned. Made me wonder if the seller was selling knock offs  I love Sambas and these were bought over a year ago and get worn daily . What can I say Adidas are classic.
"adidas I'm a solid nike 11.5, converse chuck 11 and these adidas 11.5fit me well, but are on the bigger, loose fitting side. I wouldn't play soccer with the way they are now because they're not snug.<br/>I wore them everyday for many hours standing a work, hoping they would break in and be comfortable, but the arch support and interior of the shoe feels low quality and they really hurt to stand in all day. It just feels lumpy as opposed to conformative or supportive.<br/><br/>I used to have adidas back in the day about 15 years ago and they were very comfortable, but these aren't the most comfortable, though I usually wear them all day anyway."
"adidas I love them, they are comfortable and what I was looking for, but don't know what to do with the long tongue. The tongue doesn't fold over easily, so it looks odd. Right now, I only wear them with long pants that cover the tongue, but if I could figure out how to fold the tongue over permanently I would wear the shoes with ankle pants/shorts/other things."
"adidas I buy a new pair of this exact shoe every two years or so. The previous pair becomes my work shoe, that I don't mind getting paint and such on (i work in technical theatre.) My previous work pair goes into the trunk of my car as emergency shoes (handy in a pinch if caught in rain or snow to have a dry pair.) The trunk pair, after 6 years of service, get an honorable discharge. I have followed this pattern without fail or regret for well over a decade now and will continue as long as there are Sambas to be worn! I have never found a shoe that fits my feet better, although after all this time I might have to consider that it is my feet that have come to fit the shoe..."
adidas We are the champions my friends. Put on some sambas and all of a sudden colors are brighter and music is sweeter. Life is better with a pair of these bad boys taking you from adventure to adventure.
"adidas can't beat sambas. these arrived in box, brand new, everything as expected. got them broken in and man they're comfortable. might cut down the giant tongues, though lol"
"adidas The shoes fitted well and comfortable when the pair was just received, but just after a couple of months the bottom of the right shoe deformed and curled up in the middle and started to hurt my foot. The most walking I had with the shoes was between the train station and my office, which is about 2 miles round trip, and I was just wearing it 2 or 3 days a week so I was very disappointed especially Adidas was not a bad name and so many people gave Samba such a high score."
"adidas I've been wearing these almost  exclusively for 7 or 8 years now, buying a new pair every 8-12 months. They fit me absolutely perfectly after a couple weeks of break in. I wear them for everything, and they've held up to dozens of miles backpacking, mild rock climbing, skateboarding, mountain biking...  There's no longer anything I would have reservations about trying to use Sambas for. I hope they never stop making them."
"adidas Tried one size and didn't fit. Too large. Returned for size smaller. Too small. Weird placement of arch support that made it unwearable for me. And I have never had that problem with any shoe.<br/>My wife loves them though, The arch support was just way too far forward, but your mileage may vary...."
adidas A stylish shoe that you can do pretty much anything in. Kind of wish they made a more premium version that lasted longer but whatever. These are inexpensive and a classic.
"adidas I love Sambas. One of my all time favorites and I have multiple pairs. All built well, durable and break in comfortably. They clean up well too. Can't go wrong in my opinion."
adidas Perfect fit. Perfect shoe. I saw some people saying they suspected they could be fake but if they are they're the most convincing pair of fake sambas ever and this would be my 4th pair.
"adidas A little tighter than I remember, but as always, after a break in period, they stretch.  Hope that I can get another 7 years out of these like it's predecessors."
adidas Love the way the shoe looks and it fit well. Returned my pair as the shoe tongue is extremely long and constantly rubbed on ankle. Built for soccer but I was hoping I could use them as a casual shoe with jeans.
"adidas Exactly what I wanted I used to have the same shoes before and I'm ecstatic to have such ubercool shoes. A bit snug at first but breaking them in , no problems"
"adidas I had these in black when I was 13 (now 35) and my son, now 16, has had several  pairs over the years! They're classics! They're one of the best constructed shoes you can buy and never go out of style!"
"adidas I have worn these for years.  They are by far my favorite shoe.  They are comfortable to work in, on my feet all day.  They are great indoor soccer shoes.  They are sharp to look at and very durable as far as a walking/sport/work shoe.  I do not refer to them as a work shoe in the sense of construction or chemical work type shoe.  They are not a safety boot in other words.  They lose traction on wet grass as do most tennis shoes type footwear.  They are a great shoe and anyone I have known to get them, even people who don't play sports or don't play soccer, really like their comfort.  I always here ""They are the most comfortable shoe."""
adidas I love the look of these shoes but they have too much arch support. They make my knees hurt after a few hours of wear. I was seeking a shoe to wear all day for my job. I run around a lot and need something comfortable. I'm hoping they will break in more with time but for right now they are not very comfortable.
"adidas As a New Yorker, I walk a lot and need durable, comfortable walking shoes. These are versatile and fit great. I put them through the ringer and they never let me down."
adidas These indoor soccer shoes are the best low prices shoes on the market. they provide good maneuverability on the field and good grip. they are certainly not the best well fitting  and comfortable ones on the market but I would rather pay less than 50$ on these shoes than a couple hundred on a slightly better one since I'm not a pro soccer player.<br/><br/>One thing i'm not happy with is they used some type of plastic for the tongues while the rest of the shoe is leather . This makes the tongue the weakest part of the shoe specially if you fasten it tight very often.<br/><br/>Overall I like this shoes and this is my second pair that I bought after the first one just gave up on me after 3 years.
adidas They were terribly small. No use for them
"adidas I'm replacing the exact same shoe I've had for years... This pair indicates made in China, and fits much tighter (width) than my previous pair which indicates made in India.  Note that every shoe I wear from any other manufacturer is a size 13, and these are 14's... but I knew to order larger.<br/><br/>Net: Different facility, slightly different fit I imagine is normal.  I used a shoe tree and a strategically placed sock every night for a week and they are stretching out... should be okay."
"adidas These leather ones are the only ones my husband can wear, since he needs the stretch in the width.  The synthetic leather Sambas are painful."
adidas I habought this same shoe continuously every 5 years for 25 years.  I order the same size every time but this time they do not feel the same.  Almost like wearing a narrow fit vs normal or wide.  I am not super concerned because I think they will eventually fit better as they get broken in.  However right now they do not fit well.  I am not sure if some of the company specs were not followed but something is not right with this pair.
adidas Provide great arch support. My husband is on his feet for 12+ hours 5-7 days a week. He loves these. They are the only shoes that make his back pain and fatigue manageable. They hold up well and last. He has already purchased 3 pairs and will be reordering.
adidas I accedently ordered a half size too large for my son so I am returning. He has worn this exact style shoe for years. Always has a pair in his closet. Thus the 5 stars!
"adidas Let me just say that these are very inexpensively priced shoes. So, I don't really know what I could reasonably expect from shoes in this price range, however, I had certain expectations from the Adidas brand and these don't really come close to them.<br/><br/>These shoes feel cheap and thin. The tongue is made of a thin plastic material and the soles do not feel like they provide very much support or cushioning. Overall, these shoes work for my gym routine and they don't exactly look like they're going to fall apart right away, but they're not something that I'm psyched to put on or that I feel much affinity toward."
"adidas These shoes were just what I have come to expect. Great fit, very comfortable, and very durable. Bought this pair to replace my old ones. Theres a red label on these, and another version with a blue label on the tongue. The red label sambas are the indoor soccer version, while the blue labels are the ""fashion"" version. The red label (the model im reviewing now) comes with a more comfortable insole that has arch support. These shoes fit very close to the manufacturers label size, they may be a little snug at first, but its leather. Wear them around for a few hours a day, and they will begin to stretch a little and fit your foot like a glove.<br/><br/>I've worn these shoes since I was a kid, and they haven't really changed in all those years. Still comfortable, and for the money you cannot beat the quality. I'll always have a pair of sambas in my shoe stash!<br/><br/>Been wearing my current pair around for a few months now, and they still look brand new!"
"adidas After almost 7 months of owning them they are still holding up great. These shoes do have a strong arch support so if thats not your thing be weary.<br/><br/>Update:3 months shy of 2 years of wearing these shoes and they are still holding up amazingly well. The suede has discoloration, but that is normal wear and tear. The actual sole of the shoe is still going strong, with very minimal wear. Definitely got my money's worth out of this pair of shoes."
adidas The tongue on these Samba's are huge and cut into my shin if I wear low socks.  Recommend wearing calf length socks with these shoes.
"adidas Fits kind of tight but they're supposed to. Has solid heels, quality construction, and look awesome. Important to note that they do have very good grip."
"adidas had these same shoes for years before, after 2 weeks they brake in and mold around your feet, they are great; better than Puma."
"adidas Cheap material, not made of quality leather as described. Oddly shaped and damaged. Sending info to state attorney general"
"adidas I am a new coach of a U10 boys soccer team, and wanted something to wear on the turf during practices preferably classic.  These are very well-made, with excellent sewing and quality materials.  However, I have both very flat and high-volume feet, and these shoes were simply too low-cut and low-volume to fit very well.  I was also surprised by the noticeable arch support, which I certainly noticed.  Perhaps that's one gauge of just how flat my feet are!  I tried to see if these would work for me, but finally had to decide that they would not and returned without any problems.  I only wore them on my carpeted floor of my office, in case you're wondering!"
"adidas You can't go wrong with these! I use them for indoor soccer but also as just regular sneakers. Only thing is these fit a little big, not TOOO big but a noticeable amount for sure"
"adidas Am almost perfect shoe. The only misgiving I have is that the arch in one of the shoes is ever so slightly off.  I'll adjust. Other than that, from day one they feel like my feet have known them for months with no break in period needed."
"adidas Look great!  As some of the review stated, they have high arches - much more than the normal Sambas.  After a while, they make my feet hurt - and I'm someone who requires strong arch support.  But worth the sacrifice."
"adidas I've been buying Sambas for years. Unfortunately, they changed the insole, and these are un-wearable. The arches are suuuper high. I have naturally high arches, but these are way higher than any shoe I've ever worn. I tried replacing the insole with a pair of Dr Scholls from Walgreens, but there's an irregularity in the bed of the shoe that pokes through and makes them really uncomfortable. Double-fail."
"adidas Good shoes, but to be perfectly honest I have noticed a decline in quality coming from adidas over the last ten years. This is my fourth pair of Sambas and I can tell that they have taken longer to wear in simply because they are uncomfortable enough that I take them off when I get home instead of wearing them all throughout the day like I did with my previous pairs. I can't really say I've ever found a good alternative to the Sambas from other companies. The like-modeled Pumas I had fell apart rather quick and although stiff, these shoes do last a bit longer than other brands."
adidas Great all round shoe and quality that lasts! Runs a little big compared to most my other shoes from other brands.
adidas Not fantastic for wide flat feet but take out the insole and they feel sooo much better.  Some reviewers said to just tear the arch support off of the bottom of the insole but with my foot width it feel much better to take it out completely.
"adidas Fit as expected, really great support for workouts and long lasting comfort. Few people at the gym commented that they liked the shoes. For the price these are great classics."
"adidas I love these shoes. They go perfectly off the court, as casual wear. But more importantly, I've played a lot in them, and they still don't seem like they're giving up on me any time soon. And the samba design is historically so significant, wouldn't trade it in for Nike or Puma's color explosions."
"adidas it's an indoor cleat.  Maybe it's the surface I'm using it on, which seems extra hard, but it needs a more cushioning insole, so get yourself a Dr. Scholl's.  I used it three times this week playing soccer, and Thursday night I could barely walk, my knees were really in pain, I am in good shape and had to push up on something to stand up.  However, they are stiff where it counts, so when you cut or try to change direction, the shoe doesn't slide or rotate on your foot, which is important.  Add a little cushion inside (there is room) and you're good to go."
"adidas I have been looking for a fair priced pair of these shoes and finally found them. I love sambas, as I can hike, bike, shop, and play in them with no blisters or foot pain. I had a pair that I wore everyday for about 3 years in every kind of weather condition. I only threw them away because they got irreparable damage to them after painting in them once not because they were wore out. Plus, they arrived 4 days before the estimated arrival date, which is always a plus. Happy with my purchase and this vendor. I would buy again and recommend this purchase."
adidas One of The most uncomfortable shoes I ever had. It hurts to wear them :(
"adidas I would have easily given this five stars had they come without the ""Arch support"". It takes about five seconds to remove it but man, out of the box they felt horrible until the support was removed. After that they felt like your classic Samba which are well worthy of a 5 star review for the price tag."
adidas Seemed very narrow for a D.  Well made though.  Tongue much longer than my son's who wears a very small size.
adidas The quality of these shoes are terrible. Also the fit is very poor. A 12 1/2 is to small a 13 too large. Dont Buy!
"adidas We always love sambas! I got these as a gift for my husband who grew up playing soccer and he loves them! They are his favorite shoes. His old ones were getting ratty so it was time, and amazon had the price I've seen."
"adidas I have been buying Sambas for a while now, although the last pair that I bought was probably four or five years ago. This new pair is the same size as my old pair, but seems to be a bit tighter in the toe box. The shoe fits somewhat snugly around the foot (somewhat narrow), which I like. The lack of arch support is sort of a known factor for these; they just do not do much to support your arches."
"adidas Cheap. Felt like poor quality compared to adidas samba originals. PAy the money and get the ""originals"" not ""classic"""
"adidas I love Adidas Rom and the Samba seemed to closely resemble them so purchased this pair. I find them to be comfortable and like the fact that they have leather uppers like the Rom so wear well and have give in them unlike nylon uppers parading as leather. The sole is sturdy. Yes they did squeak initially as other reviewers commented however this doesn't appear to be a permanent feature, either that or I have got used to the noise. The tongue is rather long but this is not a bad feature as it doesn't crawl to the side which my old Roms would do. All in all a great shoe.<br/>Many thanks to Amazon staff who always do a great job in ensuring that the order is dispatched swiftly and in a secure manner.<br/>Top service."
"adidas The shoes are a classic style, and I've received compliments.  They are a bit tight, but I can tell that they are stretching so that it will not be a problem. Just realize that they run  a little thinner that the width measurement indicates."
"adidas Prompt delivery, well packaged. Vendor fulfilled their end of the bargain. For whatever reason the shoes (clearly marked size 13us) fit more like size 12. My toes were smashed in the end of the shoe. I didnt even try to stand up. Very unfortunate, these are the real deal Sambas, just didnt fit."
"adidas The shoe is narrow and the arch support is woefully inadequate. They look great and are a classic old-school design, but they are not that comfortable. Wear them for show, not to play in."
"adidas Adidas knows exactly how to make soccer shoes. I use those for indoor purposes and the Kaiser 5 for outdoor activities. Love them. Fit perfectly, provide great grip but still allow you to move easily. You cannot be disappointed with Adidas soccer shoes, or any other soccer accessories from them. Don't expect those shoes to make you run faster than you actually can, like some brands actually seem to sell theirs, if you are looking for reliable, great quality and high performance indoor soccer shoes, those are perfect for you."
"adidas I have had a pair of Sambas in my possession at all times since I was in 6th grade (now in my mid-late 20s) and these shoes have never disappointed me! The arches are always a tiny bit high the first time I wear them but the insoles conform to my feet after an hour or so and they're super comfortable after that. I get years of wear from each pair I buy, and when they finally give up the ghost I just get a new pair! I love my Sambas :)"
adidas Achieving 'classic' status is more than semantics. This shoe is the real deal. It is why I keep buying them.
"adidas Awesome shoe!  Had a pair in high school, another pair in college. Really comfortable"
adidas I love these shoes and owned a pair about 10 years ago. I just bought another pair and they were way too narrow. Unfortunately I've had to return them.
adidas I bought them for me and I would never get a second pair or recommend them to a friend
"adidas these run a bit narrow, be sure to try on at a brick &amp; mortar first.<br/><br/>Sambas rule... this is the classic version with the long tongue, not the dumb new version with the blue 'originals' logo and short tongue."
"adidas Great shoes. The arches took a little while to get used to, but after a week or so, they have become my most commonly used shoes. They seem very durable so far (I've never had a pair of Adidas last for less than 4 years, so this is to be expected). I do a lot of cross training, and I have found that these work well for that as well as for casual use. The only issue is that the tongue of the shoe is very long (as they are soccer shoes), so if you do not wear long socks, the tongues will rub up against your shins. I now fold the tongues down over the laces of the shoes to avoid scraping my leg hair off :)"
adidas I play indoor soccer and this is the only shoe I will wear. Samba's are the best and I 100% recommend to anyone looking for great indoor shoes.
"adidas Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. He wears them everyday and with all different outfits! He wears them casually to class, but also worn them during his internship at work and they paired well with all outfits. They're very comfortable and provide good support for his feet and he has never had any issues. They are also still very white, even after nonstop wear over 5 months, they hold up well!"
"adidas When I first put them on out of the box, they were almost too tight (narrow) for comfort on one of my feet. I immediately thought that I may have ordered the wrong size, but I decided to see if they might loosen up in a day or two. I'm glad they did, because these shoes are great!<br/>I bought these because I had heard that they last FOREVER, so we'll see if that is the case. But in the meantime, these are stylish, comfortable shoes that I can wear anywhere to do anything."
"adidas Excellent quality and comfort.<br/>I was looking for this model in Monterrey Mexico but nowhere was my number (5¬Ω) (6 ¬Ω in USA) so I decided to buy here.<br/>I was unsure of the size I should order, but they fitted me perfect.<br/>The shipment was fast but they came one day after it was marked as possible delivery, but nothing to bother (after intensive search, I did not mind waiting one day more).<br/>Also came packaged correctly.<br/><br/>In conclusion:<br/>They are excellent for walking since they are very comfortable to step. Quality is appropriate even for a more demanding sports like playing football.<br/>Highly recommended."
adidas I packed mine for 3-4 days with tissue to expand the toe on the shoe. They are pretty narrow (I wear a 12 sometimes 12.5 size shoe) I took them out on the weekend on a road trip and did some walking around the town I vistied and they are still a bit narrow.<br/><br/>**BUY A .5 size higher then what you wear** || **BUY A .5 size higher then what you wear**  || **BUY A .5 size higher then what you wear**
adidas My son has had about a dozen of these shoes.  They last long for normal wear of a teenager.  Great style.
adidas Not sure that this is just this pair but Samba I used many years ago was much more comfortable than this pair.
"adidas Was looking for a turf to play football in on grass (or dirt because of the drought here in Jamaica) or on asphalt but saw this and has always been a fan but just never wore a pair before. The price is great, the fit is perfect and the contact on the ball is immaculate- just nice and cushioned when foot meets ball for a pass and especially when taking a shot. The thing that amazes me is the grip it provides on the dirt to sandy playing surface as I was thinking I'd be sliding all over the place but that was far from being the case."
"adidas These are excellent shoes. I've been buying Sambas for years now.  It can be difficult to find quality casual shoes.  I know these are really indoor soccer shoes, but they are fantastic for walking around in and wearing casually. They are extremely comfortable and they last for many years, even if worn on a daily basis.  Since they have been making this same style for so many years, there is no risk of a piece of tread wearing unevenly or falling off, or material near the toe wearing, or the heal support failing.  This is consistent quality and I'd recommend to anyone."
"adidas I've worn these Men's Samba Classic shoes now for over 10 years.  They are by far the most comfortable athletic shoes on the market, in my opinion.  However, for extended walking, I do recommend getting orthotic inserts to provide better arch support, as there really isn't much in these shoes.  The inserts really make the shoes perfect for heavy, long walks without foot fatigue.  You can get the inserts at most drug stores, under a variety of brand names."
adidas I've worn these shoes for a long time and they always last forever. They do take a little while to break in but once they do they are the perfect shoes.
"adidas I wear these all day, I go to the school, to the gym, everywhere with them. They do have a noticeable arch support so I feel it a lot when I run with them so I just change shoes. That doesn't take out any of the durability though. I cut off the tongue was much to big but did not want to get the other version of this shoe as they aren't as reliable. The leather on these is real and very durable. I even use them for mechanic work. Boss shoes."
"adidas Arch feels weird, but may just be my arch. All around pretty sweet shoes!"
"adidas The shoes are very comfortable, and classics. I didn't have any blisters or discomfort after the first time I wore them for an indoor game. These do run a bit larger than other brands I tried on in-store (unfortunately I do not live near a store that carry these sambas)...I would make a note as they are about a half size bigger in fit than the Nikes I tried on."
"adidas Been using Sambas for years now. It is that type of shoe that you can wear all day long without any issues. And if you are adventurous like me, wear them with a suite. Bottom line is, super comfortable shoe, is a bit narrow for a little but the Sambas stretch nicely without loosing their shape. If you don't like the longer tongue, you can alway buy the street versions that have the shorter tongue and the Adidas logo at the back. The do feel the same."
"adidas One of the best casual or indoor soccer shoes available. Comfortable, insanely durable, and fit great if you have wider feet. (I'm a size 13). This is my fourth pair in 12 years. I still have all four pairs but the older two are too worn to play in now. I just wear them as beater shoes every now and again. I play indoor soccer with them all the time and I also wear them pretty much everywhere else too."
"adidas I read a review here saying give your feet a week to adjust to these shoes. It is very true, these shoes have arch support not found in many athletic shoes. As someone who has been wearing nothing but flat footed skate shoes for 8 years, I have no arches in my feet, they are flat. However, the longer i have been wearing these shoes, I can feel myself walking more upright, feeling more comfortable on my feet, and the big tongues on these help me out style just about anyone. Great product and I am looking forward to owning these for years."
"adidas They really don't make these like they used to.  For those unaware, Sambas used to come in leather and kangaroo leather (Samba K).  They later started making these, the Samba Classic, as an affordable option (same looks but nowhere near as durable).  I'm not sure when the quality Sambas quit getting made, but the K was finally discontinued in 2012, leaving only this Classic/economy version.  I really regret not keeping my Samba K's from 20 years ago and re-soling them, because I think those shoes could outlive me.  The cheap ones that are the only ones available since 2012?  Not so much.  Adidas really should have kept the quality shoes an option, but planned obsolescence is the name of the game these days.<br/><br/>As for what I mean about quality, I wore holes clean through to my socks in both shoes exactly where the ball of my foot lands in less than 20 hours of play on AstroTurf.  In fact, the entire sole wore down very quickly.<br/><br/>Still, they're good ol' Sambas: they fit great, are very comfortable and easy to break in, and points for not changing the style in forty years."
adidas They are sambas.  Not the most comfy shoe but it is what it is.
adidas These were purchased as a replacement for my Husband's sambas from a few years ago. They were the same as the ones he currently owns but we're so small he couldn't put his foot in them. When we held them up to his current shoes of the same size they were noticeably smaller.
"adidas I've bought these shoes @ Khols without knowing that they're meant for soccer because they look awesome.Let's see Here... I bought them @ second semester of junior year in High school. Now I'm 2nd year in college using it to play indoor soccer.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1) Comfortable  -&gt; I wear it for casual occasions (before it got dirty from activities)<br/>2) tough and well made -&gt; This shoe has the longest lifespan compared all shoes I've worn.<br/>3) Not too flashy and very low profile, but it's still classy<br/>4) Recommended for indoor courts -&gt; Although it's meant for soccer, I also use it for badminton, tennis, and basketball , because I'm cheap like that. =P<br/><br/>Cons(only towards the end of my third year):<br/>1) tip of the laces started ripping<br/>2) back of the shoes started ripping<br/>3) I didn't like the tongue design but it's a minor thing.<br/><br/>It served me well till the end. Now, I just bought a white one from amazon cuz it's on sale. &gt;.&lt;<br/>I'd recommend it for anyone who plays court sports. I also use insoles for extra comfort and this also prevents feet injury."
"adidas As a woman wearing a men's size, I found the shoes to be slightly roomier than expected, so they do slide slightly with thinner socks. However, they offer great arch support and I think if I went a size smaller they would be too narrow. These were my favorite shoes when I was a kid, and I'm happy to say that they're still a quality, comfortable, supportive shoe, even if it's slightly harder to find a perfect fit as an adult woman."
"adidas Not as comfortable. Therefore, don't wear on regular basis."
"adidas At this point, I love these shoes. They were recommended to me by a college-soccer player who swears by them. He has had the same pair for years now; soaked in mud, rain, dirt, all conditions on and off the field, and they have yet to tear (granted, they don't smell great at this point). I have a feeling I'm going to be wearing these shoes for a long time.  And as far as I'm concerned they're much better looking then so many of the ever-changing fads these days. These are classic and timeless, you can't go wrong with proven success!"
"adidas For an indoor soccer shoe, I was surprised at how narrow these were.  Personally, I sent them back because something is up with the way my right foot contacts the ground when I stand, so when it was in this shoe it felt very pinched.  I don't have the same problems with my left foot, but even without that pinching feeling, they were still too narrow.  It would be difficult for me to lift weights in these shoes, let alone play a sport that involves running and cutting.  I have been told that I have average-width feet as well.  Good material quality and craftsmanship otherwise.  4 Stars."
"adidas These Samba shoes last forever. I have a problem in my right foot, After spraining my ankle a few times, I dont step in a straight way. So, all my shoes or sneakers wear out really fat on the back right side of my right foot. Except these ones. I have had them maybe for about 2 years and they still look brand new. I have run a lot with them, played baseball, basketball and use them to go to the university and also for everyday use.<br/><br/>I have been buying these shoes for about 8 years. I had a pair before that lasted me 3 years or more (astarted to wear out inside, not outside, due to overuse), after that I gave them to my cousin, he used them for about a year, then sold them.<br/><br/>Needless to say, click add to cart and proceed to check out. I am now looking into the adidas gazelle, but still expensive."
"adidas They fit a bit narrow, as expected.  Have worn these shoes for years."
adidas Perfect shoe! I bought them for my husband and they fit him perfectly
adidas I have had numerous pairs of these shoes they all fit the same and are very comfortable!
"adidas The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 was because it was a bit small. I use these shoes as a lifting boot because of the flat and stable sole, so it really doesn't matter to me if they are a bit too small. If I was to get these shoes for indoor soccer or for a casual shoe then I would have definitely needed a half size larger for my toes to not feel like they are all squashed together. But all around I'm pretty happy with the shoe and the quick delivery!"
"adidas I have been buying these shoes since I was 11 (3 pairs ago) &amp; I am 16 now! They look pretty good with any clothes and are comfortable when broken in. When I first buy them, they are tight and the arch is too high for my foot. The leather, however, stretches and the arch changes to fit your foot. After about a week, these shoes feel like a custom fit. I play soccer with friends and they are amazing for that too. Of course, I wouldn't recommend these for a world cup  futsal game, but they work for me. Only complaint is that the tongue is occasionally vexing but that can be fixed easily (tucked in, cut, folded over).<br/><br/>Update 12/3/13: I've worn out this pair and I bought another in the hemp variety because they were to only ones that came in a cardinal color. Just as good the fifth time around. Sambas are the best."
"adidas This is a timeless classic. Fashion trends may change, but the samba will always be cool."
"adidas i cant speak about these shoes as far as soccer shoes but as lifestyle shoes they are great. they look sick as hell. the leather and suede is clean af. surprised that this dope and quality of a shoe can come so cheap. if you are deciding between these and the short tongue version (original classic i think) go with these, the long tongue is sick and makes em stand out. solid ass shoe cop em no doubt"
"adidas Best shoes I've ever bought. Very comfortable with lots of support, and extremely durable. The last pair I bought I had for over a year and there was hardly any wear or damage to them, and if probably still have them if I didn't lose them. Glad I finally found them on here for a decent price."
"adidas Awesome shoes for anything that requires flat soles.<br/>I personally love using these for lifting as they provide great support and stability. I have also played football (soccer) and long-boarded in them. They have a great durable sole and awesome comfort.<br/>Also, they are better than the other version of this shoe not meant as indoor soccer, the sole is more durable in this shoe!"
adidas All my son will wear. It says it is the perfect shoe.
"adidas If you are a size 9, get an 8 1/2.....Also is narrow"
"adidas I'd like to look of this classic shoe and also the wear comfort.<br/><br/>But the Quality is not what I'm used to know from ADIDAS, after 6 months there appeared a hole on my right shoe and a little bit later the same happened at the same spot with my left shoe.<br/><br/>I didn't wear them very often, so that was not worth the money..."
adidas Feel as great as they did when I wore them in middle school! Very comfortable but you do have to know that the tongue of the shoe extends quite high up and might not be for everybody
"adidas Good little shoe. Cut the tongue out, of course."
"adidas Adidas Samba shoes are the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn, I have been wearing these type of shoes for over 10-15 years. I have worn these shoes until my big toe has been exposed. This particular pair I just purchased because I had worn my old pair out to the point they are no longer wearable. The old pair lasted me almost 4 years. So if your looking for a quality shoe at a great price, you can't go wrong with these. I'm a die-hard fan of Adidas Samba's shoes."
"adidas Got these for my son as he loves the Samba shoes.. has always had Black, got him these and he thinks he's a style guru.. he said everyone at school loves them!!  The online price is too good to pass up.,. I'll be getting him another pair soon I expect.."
adidas If you have wide toes this will be a little tight in the toe box
"adidas I just got mine this morning then I decided to put them on for the rest of the day. After wearing them for almost 12 hours, i gotta tell you this is an AMAZING pair of shoes. Extremely comfortable. I even tested them on the soccer field, and they feel just as great as when I walk on the pavement. Great for casual outfits and also great for running.<br/><br/>I'm in love with these shoes. Fit perfectly, no squeaky sound, and the large tongues don't bother me at all (you barely feel the them).<br/>I'd definitely recommend these shoes. and for $43, you can't go wrong with these shoes."
"adidas I have owned a lot of Adidas in the past.  I am a woman who wears a size 8 in women's and 6.5 in men's.  I have never had any issue with my adidas in the past but there were very wide in the heel and my foot kept slipping out.  Too bad. Have to send them back.  Otherwise, standard adidas wear."
"adidas I've been wearing Sambas for about five years. I wear them literally every day and they never let me down. I wear these shoes into the ground, too. I'll go hiking in them, play soccer in them, and they never fail. I have my ritual of just buying a new pair every year, and I even keep the old pairs because they're still completely wearable. I will admit, the break in period is never exactly comfy, but once they're broken in, they're the best shoes in the world."
"adidas I have lots of adidas, these are my least favorite to date. The toe box is narrow and the arch support is too high and stiff. The rubber compound of the  soles makes them downright dangerous on wet pavement. Because they are flat, firm and slick, hydro planing is a constant worry. Good luck not hurting yourself in them, somewhat stylish though."
adidas Love them bit too small gotta trade em in for a 7 1/2
adidas I love sambas. I have owned several pairs over the years and I like switching back and forth between the mostly black version and this mostly white version. This version of the shoe has not broken in at all over the last year or more that I've owned it. Very disappointing. These shoes usually break in pretty quickly and are very comfortable. This version is not comfortable and squishes my feet (width too narrow). Not sure what changed but I hope I can find the older style for my next pair that I order
adidas I have bought these many times in the past in a size 13 and never had a problem. This time they were too small and needed to return the product.
adidas Shoes ran very small for the sizes stated.  I normally wear a size 9.5 and I doubt a size 10. would have fit either so I didn't exchange them for a larger size or I would have.  The shoes look great.  The service from Amazon was again top notch.  It's no wonder Amazon leads the E- Commerce industry.  Keep up the great work!!!
"adidas Perfect adidas, as they are every time I buy sambas."
adidas very cool looking and very good price.
"adidas The classic soccer shoes that's basically unchanged for 20+ years because there's no reason to do so. Great design. The only complaint I have with these is the arch seems to be too far forward for me. I have not had this problem with other shoes (including Sambas) in the past, and otherwise they fit perfectly, so I plan to wear them for a bit and hope they adjust some."
"adidas Now these shoes are the real deal. They are tough and are build to last you for a while, that is for certain. The mid foot arch support is crazy. First putting these on, it felt really uncomfortable to walk for a while but as I figured, they broke in after about a day of usage and now they feel great. The worn in arch support actually has fit to the shape of my foot and now makes them comfier than my other shoes."
"adidas I still have my 5+ years old pair of Sambas sitting in the closet and aside from looking like they've been through hell, they still feel great. I decided though for under $50 I'd get a new pair and they seem to be of the same high quality as my old ones... with one flaw. Without knowing it, they changed the arch support... or should I say added it? The old ones don't really have any at all, and to me, that was actually pretty comfortable. These new ones feel like someone shoved a couple of baseballs in my shoes... it's not a deal breaker, but I wish they had offered the new arch support as an option, as given the choice I wouldn't have wanted it. I'm hopeful that with some wear it'll compress the new arch support as to not be so noticeable, but only time will tell on that one. Even so, I'm only removing 1 star because they're still the best looking sneakers in the world, and the only ones I'll ever be seen in public with."
adidas The tongue of the shoe is to long it lays high on foot(where you bend foot). So it feels awkward.
"adidas Love my new Samba's - This has been my 3rd pair over the years - quality, materials, and design are all as expected - only complaint is I prefer a more minimalist shoe and this set seems to have more of an arch support then the previous pairs I have owned - all and all would make purchase again - food for thought, these shoes can take a beating and last for a good while"
"adidas Have owned, worn, sported these shoes for 4 decades. They have never once let me down. They are like The Stones. Timeless classics. Best if outfitted with a work shoe insole for extended comfort. Once broken in feel better than slippers. Just wish they would offer these shoes in more colors like the lower grade models made out of canvas."
"adidas Glad these are back in, fit great"
adidas I love these! So comfortable and they are really good looking. I usually wear a size 9 women's and I ordered the size 7 Samba's. Perfect fit! I am so happy with these. I am on my feet all day at work and these are very comfortable to wear all day. I highly recommend them!!
adidas I like it.  But YOU MUST TAKE OUT THE ARCH SUPPORT.  TAKE THE SHOE SOLE OUT REMOVE THE ARCH SUPPORT PUT THE SOLE BACK IN  AND IT TURNS  THIS PRODUCT FROM 2 STAR TO A 4 STAR. .
"adidas Sambas are the best shoe of all time.  I've owned probably 8 pairs through my life, I've worn them since I was a little kid.  Great, classic look.  Perfect casual shoe to wear out with jeans, great for working out in, and great for playing soccer on hard surfaces.  Honestly these shoes can be worn for almost every situation, I love them."
"adidas Very good , i satisfied , good quality"
adidas Great shoes at a great price!
"adidas My BF love the shoes , he wears them everyday!!i got him white ones for Father's Day and black ones for his bday he s very happy with these shoes"
adidas Gift for friend - perfect fit and comfortable right out of the box. He's worn classic Sambas for 20+ years and these more than met his expectations.
"adidas I have ordered these shoes before so that is why I state that they fit as expected. However, please understand that my feet are narrow to medium width, both in the toe and ankle areas. With regard to length, I consider them to be the correct length for the size. Hope this helps!"
adidas A bit tight on the toes but look good
"adidas I have two sets shoes. My work boots and these. I discovered these years ago, and have sins never bought anything ells. Great build quality, great fit, and they dont make my back hurt like other shoes do. Im flat footed and have lower back problems and find that these shoes help me out. May not be the same for other people with the same symptoms.<br/>On a side note, for those people who like spirited driving or drive in autocross events, these are good driving shoes if you dont want to spend $150+ and a set of purpose made racing shoes. You dont really need fire resistant shoes for weekend hooning do you? No I dont think so"
"adidas Fantastic quality shoe. 10/10, would recommend to a friend. This is my 9th pair of sambas and I love them to death<br/>The materials are very high quality and they're super comfortable for everyday use. Also they're very grippy and flat, so theyre excellent for gym activities like squatting and deadlifting."
adidas Nice looking! Classic Adidas.
"adidas I had a pair of adidas Sambas a long time ago, which were all nubuck leather. This may be the difference. While these have suede uppers, they just never broke in and always felt way too narrow for comfort, and I have a fairly narrow to normal width foot as well.<br/><br/>Compared to something like the Oniksuka Ultimate 81s these run slightly smaller much more narrow in the toe box and mid-foot areas (for equivalent sizes). I really wanted to like these having worn them before and using other adidas shoes, especially for the price on Amazon, but I ended up giving them away after only a few months of uncomfortable wear."
adidas My son likes these shoes. I think they look kind of cheap.
adidas Goes well with pants I've seen here.
"adidas They fit true to size but there is no arch whatsoever in this sneaker and after a while of wearing them my feet hurt.  However, the look is sharpe and stylish but I can only wear them for a short time."
"adidas Great shoes, just be aware that they do run a bit on the small side, so take that into account when you're ordering. I have long, somewhat narrow feet, and these fit snug, but not uncomfortably so."
adidas This is his third pair
"adidas It's almost been a year since I got the adidas, and they're still going strong. Most of my gym shoes have holes in them or are falling apart by now. Not these. If they ever break down, I'm going to buy them again."
"adidas Two things that felt slightly strange: 1. the front flap at the ankle seemed longer than I initially thought, but it's not a huge problem or anything. 2. the back of the shoe, near the heel section, felt a bit loose but also not a big problem. I sprinted and played soccer indoors with these and they were pretty nice. It's a bit hard to kick under the ball and get lift with these, but they're really good for the price."
"adidas This is the second pair of theses exact shoes I bought because the first pair lasted me 2 and a half years and I loved them so much I bought them again! I love the style (even though I don't play soccer) and I love the comfort and support, especially the arch support, these shoes have. The sizes seem to run pretty accurate, as I am a size 12 and they fit just right. I also like the color scheme of black and brown (with the iconic three stripes of course) as it doesn't let dirt show as easily as white-bottomed shoes do. Definitely recommended."
"adidas for some freakin reason I can never find a pair of stylish shoes that are sized correctly. It's not my feet because for my pair of doc martens my right boot is too tight on the pinky toe, but on these adidas the left shoe is too tight in the same area. The other shoe in both cases fits perfectly.<br/><br/>Whatever. I'll get callouses soon enough."
adidas This particular make and brand of shoe I have worn for them nearly EVERYDAY for over 35 years. They are comfortable from the start and get more comfortable every time you wear them!!
"adidas Good indoor shoes, but run narrow sole.  Also, the heal arch is a little aggressive and hard in this style. I hope the arch starts to soften after some more wear."
"adidas I have very weird feet and every shoe I wear hurts them. I purchased these after seeing the multiple reviews of them being the best and most comfortable shoes around. I was not dissapointed! They look really nice and I wear them everywhere! They are so comfy my feet thank me everytime I wear them. I'm a woman and wear horrible fitting shoes because they are cute, but these are by far my favorite out of all of my collection. I can't say anything else but how much I love them. I wish I found them years ago!"
adidas My son likes these.
adidas Its an Adidas Samba what more can you say this shoe is comfy tough and great. I used to have a pair of these as a kid and back then I trashed shoes in months but that pair of old beaten up Sambas of mine kept coming back for more. Adidas Vietnam thank you for making such a great shoe.
"adidas I've been wearing adidas Samba shoes for about four years now. I love the fit and feel of them. They are durable and haven't ripped or broken in any way, they just get very dirty after a few years, which I'm pretty sure all shoes have that problem.<br/><br/>I often wear the mainly black ones, but as I was searching for a new pair of shoes I saw this color pattern (mainly white, black stripes). It's also cool, but still simple. I have had this pair of shoes for almost six months and it still looks great.<br/><br/>I will say that I have pretty flat feet and somewhat narrow feet, and these shoes fit me perfectly. I'm not sure if they would work well for someone with wider feet, but to anyone else I would reccomend them. They are cool, feel great, and are durable. Very happy with my purchase."
"adidas Such a classic shoe at such a great price. I use them for lifting and for dancing, and they have been excellent for both. They are lightweight but still sturdy. The only thing you have to get used to is the arch support (especially if you are a lifter), but once you are used to it, these shoes feel great. Can't beat the classic Adidas style either--the leather takes these shoes to another level!"
"adidas This samba classic was ok.  however, there is this bulge in the inside of the show that makes my feet uncomfortable.  After a couple of hours it could be extremely painful.  If you know that, then you'll get what you expected.  if you didn't, you will think there was something odd about the shoe.  i think that is how they made it.  didn't like though."
adidas Boy......were these narrow! I did not last thirty seconds with the right shoe on (partially on). They looked good out of the box! I wish they offered E width.
"adidas Love the quality of these shoes and seem like theyd be very comfortable. But they're at least a half size too small. Ordered 10 1/2 which fits my foot perfectly on almost every shoe I buy. In this shoe, my toes are firmly pressed against the front inside of the upper. Free returns are great but when I went to reorder them, the price was $6 more than what I paid. Buyers should be aware that the front half of the upper (aka toe box) is very narrow and constricting as well. This adds to the overall small size aspect."
adidas Excellent quality
"adidas Glad I ordered a 9.5 ( I wear 11 in women's on average). After loosening up the laces a bit, they fit as expected. And although they are for flat feet, I've done quite a bit of walking in them and can only imagine them getting more comfortable as I break them in. I don't see myself walking/running to exercise in these but for city walking, they do the job. I've already gotten compliments."
"adidas They're comfortable shoes. I've worn them for a few weeks now. The only complaint that I have is that the tongue on the shoe is fairly long and it often slides to right or left as I'm walking. This makes the shoe look fairly ugly, especially when wearing shorts. If you're wearing pants, the long pant leg will cover up the tongue and it won't be a problem. So that's something to consider."
"adidas The length is fine, maybe even slightly longer than expected, but they are quite narrow. I need a wide shoe, and they didn't offer wide in my size, and these shoes were narrow even for a regular fit.  I fixed it pretty well by loosening the laces. I'm hoping they stretch with time. I mainly ordered these shoes because I need a good arch support. They definitely have that. If the shoe holds up over time I may order another pair to replace them. I can deal with them being too narrow for such a good arch support."
"adidas I bought these for a women and imagine some of the fit issues may be gender related.  They are really narrow in the toe but are relaxing as I wear them. The arch sits a little off from my natural arch, just enough to notice the arch, not enough to make it incredibly uncomfortable.  I chose these because I had a similar pair when I was much younger and loved the fit and style.  I am not as active anymore so these are a casual shoe for me now."
"adidas love these shoes, this is my 6th pair and the only shoe I can wear day after day.  They're not perfect but don't do anything awful and therefor I can wear them everyday.  I do use an insole (Superfeet) but I find that the older I get, I need an insole for every shoe.  They have a somewhat high arch which seems to flatten over time.  I work in photo studios which are very hard on the feet since it's hard concrete and these shoes perform well since they aren't too soft or too stiff."
adidas comfortable
adidas LOVE IT!!!
adidas Classic comfort and style at a reasonable price.
"adidas Back to old school.  I had a pair of Nike indoor shoes I really liked but they final came apart.  There were a rare bird for soccer shoes<br/>a wide shoe.  I have wide feet.  I am 55 years old and still play.  Must soccer shoes are very tight.  These are tight, but leather so<br/>I broke them in in a week walking around the block.  Now they are comfortable."
adidas Awesome!!
"adidas I went to a store to try on a pair of Sambas. They were size 12 and were way too tight. The store didn't have anything larger, and I assumed that with the 12 being so tight, a 13 would fit the most comfortably. I made the wrong choice and ordered size 13, which was too big. I'm hoping that means a 12 and a half would fit just right."
"adidas These shoes feel great! They do have a little arch on the inside of foot area.but other than that you get used to it. They feel great when I walk around for casual wear and I get compliments on them.<br/>Side note:<br/>Complaining about shoe size is no big deal, simply return the shoe and get a bigger size. People complaining about ""size too small or size too big"". It seriously depends on your foot and not everybody has the same foot or feel about the shoes."
adidas Same Sambas I remembered from high school. Awesome.
"adidas I originally started wearing these shoes in high school for indoor soccer. I loved them so much, I started wearing them just as my every day school shoes. Now as a 30 year old nurse, I bought another pair, after constantly searching for shoes that could handle long hours on my feet. They didn't disappoint. I wear them for 10+ hours per day, with no issues."
"adidas Love the Sambas. In my experience, these shoes take a day or two to get worn in, but after that, very comfortable, and great for indoor.<br/><br/>The thing I'm not totally convinced on is the tongue. Sticks up a little high, and can be a bit annoying rubbing against your shin.  Doesn't really look good if folded down, but luckily after a while you get used to it."
adidas Bought these shoes to wear while coaching soccer even though they are technically indoor shoes. Sambas are an all around shoe because you can wear them as causal sneaks and on the field. Obviously not a substitute for cleats but fine for coaching or refereeing. They do fit a bit narrow and have a high arch. They don't take long to get broken in though and are very comfortable.
"adidas great deal, shoes look nice arrived quickly all was great,"
"adidas They are a little narrow. I purchased a half size larger than my typical size as recommended by several reviewers. Had I not, I most certainly would have returned them. I'm keeping the pair and hoping they feel a bit roomier as they break in. They're not intolerable now, but they're not perfect either."
adidas loves
adidas GREAT ARCH SUPPORT IN SHOE!!!!  AWSOME INDOOR SOCCER SHOE!!!
"adidas Personally I prefer these Sambas compared to the Originals Sambas.<br/>I had to return the Originals Sambas since they squeaked like crazy, but these do not squeak.<br/>The tongue is a bit too long, but they are an iconic feature of the Sambas.<br/>I chose the size recommended by Amazon size recommendation, but turned out to be a bit tighter."
adidas love them
adidas Adidas is good quality
adidas Love these shoes.
"adidas These are great, everyday casual shoes with a timeless look.  The length is about right, but they're on the narrow side...  I normally wear a 10D (standard width), but my pinky toes seem to stretch beyond the footprint of these shoes.  They stretch easily though, so they're acceptable.  I just worry that they won't age well."
adidas an uncomfortable shoe in my opinion
adidas fine
"adidas I've worn these since I started playing soccer when my family was stationed in Fairbanks, AK. That was 20 years ago and I still can't find a shoe that comes close. I recently wandered around the mall trying to find a pair in person, but there weren't any. I've only been able to find them online. I really hope Adidas doesn't discontinue this shoe."
adidas Feel nothing like the sambas I wore back in high school. The shoe feels very hard and uncomfortable fit. The sole feels like hard rubber. Waste of money.
"adidas My doctor said I needed shoes with firm soles as running shoes were causing me foot pain.  When I first started wearing these, it took a while to get used to--it was like learning how to run again.  They don't provide much cushioning so I wouldn't recommend them for high-impact sports like basketball, but my foot pain did go away after converting to these."
"adidas Ok. There is a reason that I am able to buy the same exact pair of shoes today that they sold back in the early 80's. They continue to make this exact same shoe because people buy them and people buy them because people love them. These shoes are extremely well made, durable, and look great. They do lack the modern sole and cushion technology of today's shoe but that is probably not why you are buying this shoe. They look great with jeans and go with almost all casual wear. They look great for about a year of constant wear which is really saying something. This is my third pair. I keep coming back. I will probably be wearing  them 20 years from now.<br/><br/>P.S. Contrary to what the picture indicates, I bought the black pair with white stripes."
"adidas I bought these shoes for my teenage daughter. They are somewhat too large for her, but that's not because the size isn't as expected, but because her size wasn't available and we bought 'up' and are allowing for her feet to grow into the shoes. She absolutely loves them. They are cool and hip yet quality shoes that won't harm her feet as they grow. For now, she wears them with her thick soccer socks and all is well."
"adidas My boyfriend bought these from my account and he loves them. Fit well, and they're really nice shoes for a guy."
"adidas If you're like me and hate the excessively high arch support on these shoes, just peel back the insole and remove the piece of foam where the arch support is. Everything is glued together with tacky glue, it's still tacky, so you can put the insole back. The shoes feel so much better after removing those foam pieces."
adidas fell apart within a week
"adidas My last pair lasted almost 6 years, we'll see how long these do!"
"adidas Wore this shoe when I was younger playing court soccer. Never had a problem with it then. Went through several pairs. As an adult, I feel this shoe fills an excellent sport-casual role. It's a performance shoe when you need it to be, and it's got classic styling. I wear the tongue folded. I had to oil the leather and the felt and leave them rubber-banded for the first few weeks of wear to get it to fold over. My only reservation is that the arch support could be placed a little farther back in the shoe, to really 'cup' the heel. But overall I am super impressed by the rest of the support. The footbed hits all three arches in the foot, not just the main one, and when oiled regularly the leather really becomes supple and glove-like on the foot."
adidas Nice
"adidas I have had these shoes for four (4) years thus far, and they have been through thick and thin. I used them for soccer, lifting, and casual wear. They are extremely comfortable, especially after you break them in. The only reason I am buying another pair now is because my white sambas are really dirty (no holes or tears) and my girlfriend is making me get new ones. These have lasted longer than every pair of running shoes I have gotten. Get them!"
"adidas The latest memory-foam walking and running shoes are all too bouncy. I greatly prefer the solid feel of classic Sambas. They're great shoes!<br/><br/>But they run a little small in size. I normally wear size 11 shoes, but for Sambas, I need to buy size 11¬Ω."
"adidas These shoes are definitely long and narrow. I generally wear a size 10 men's. I found the size 10 Sambas to be way too long for my feet, and actually found the size 9 fit best. I wish this was available in a wide fit, as the toe box was initially a bit cramped in the size 9, however, as the shoes stretch and break-in, they're beginning to fit just right."
"adidas Way too skinny for my feet. Look great, though I had to return them."
"adidas I have a wide foot. They are not available in wide sizes. I was able to try them on at a store before purchasing them. The store did not have my exact size. I took a chance and ordered them from Amazon. They are somewhat tight in the toes, but are adequate for a couple hours of activity such as gym, etc."
"adidas As far as I can tell, Adidas doesn't  make the Samba for women. Men's to Women's shoe sizing conversion can be all over the place, here's my opinion on these: I usually wear an 8 in sneakers, I ordered the 6.5 (seems to be the smallest size offered). They seem a little big but definitely workable especially since my feet are a tiny bit wide. If you are smaller than an 8, or if your feet run narrow, you should probably look for something else. There is a lot of room in the toe box, almost too much. I would have taken a 6 if it had been available, but these will work. Also, as other reviewers have said, these feature a pretty aggressive arch support. I like it, but it might be an issue for some people. Style-wise, they are a little chunkier than I was expecting after seeing them on men, but I think that's attributable to the proportions of the smaller sizes. At $40, I think they are a great value."
"adidas If you don't buy sambas, you are not buying shoes that will last forever"
"adidas The look of the shoe is as advertised, which is what I expected. Therefore my 3 star review of the product is related to how the shoe feels in comparison to my expectations. I don't have a wide foot, however the shoes felt quite narrow. I would recommend ordering a half size higher than you would a shoe that fits 100% true to size."
adidas Way too big...I ordered a size 10 and they fit like a size 11. They have been just sitting in my closet and the black suede is fading and looking grey. Wish I had noticed sooner and sent them back for a new size or color. Be weary of ordering your regular size in these.
"adidas I have a slim foot (soccer foot), many of the complaints of the Sambas, and other football shoes, is that: they are too slim, too small, not the right arch support... bah. Be an adult and do the research, it's up to you. I have high arches, Adidas works. I can wear Sambas everyday, and they'll still last me two years! Fact! Ask Seattlelite Rainn Wilson."
"adidas I love these shoes, these are my fourth pair! I read some reviews that said they squeak, and these did initially (not very much) but now that I have worn them for a few months the squeaking is gone. I love Sambas because they are extremely comfortable once broken in, I can wear them all day and not have any aches in my feet. I tend to wear mine for 2-3 years before they need to be replaced."
"adidas Love my Sambas. They stand the test of time, both in functionality and style, and are super comfortable to boot. One thing though- the arch support can be really uncomfortable but if you remove the insole from the shoe, the support peels off quite easily and you're back in business. 5 stars"
"adidas In my opinion, Sambas run a bit large, especially length-wise. If you have wider feet, this may be a consideration for you but I love these shoes(although I'm sure its not much of an issue), they are classics. I forgot how much of an arch they have, making them the best pair of shoes I've had in a while. Highly recommend."
"adidas an instant classic. the most comfortable and stylish shoe for the price in my opinion. i feel as though i will buy these shoes every time i need new shoes for a while. they go with pretty much any outfit and you can walk as much as you want without worrying about the gum rubber soles rubbing down, so people who drag their feet when they walk should rejoice with this classic footwear from adidas."
"adidas The arch felt very uncomfortable when I first put them on, but after even a few minutes they felt better and were simply providing good arch support. Now, they have broken in and have molded well to my feet. I get lots of complements on the classic, clean style."
"adidas These are gorgeous shoes and if it were for looks only, I would give 5 stars. But the comfort is average -- it fits like any shoe should without any problems, but nothing really standout about them. It took a few wears to break them in, but after that they fit and felt just fine."
"adidas My 19-year old son is hard on shoes, and tends to run through sneakers pretty fast, but these appear to be holding up OK.  He likes the classic style and low-key color (he bought all black with the 3 stripes)."
adidas Bought these 1/2 a size bigger then my normal size and still had to send them back and get another full size up for them to fit decent. I really like the shoe but I hope they wear in quick because I don't care for the insoles. I think these are made for people with skinny feet.
adidas These shoes are the best.  Classic and comfortable.
"adidas I'm a D width in most shoes, occasionally a W or 2E width with some newbalance sneakers and a pair of dockers dress shoes I own.  These shoes were much too narrow for my feet, even after using a shoe stretcher on them for a few days.  They look decent, but if you have slightly wide feet like me, they probably aren't going to work."
"adidas A great show that I mistakenly ordered a half size too large. I was basing my choice on the average sizes of my shoes (since all brands are different). When I exchanged them for a half size smaller they have been the most comfortable shoes. I bought them because they were mentioned in a list of great shoes for driving stick and I had previously owned them in high school. In short, they are perfect."
adidas Great shoe line them alot
"adidas I decided not to keep these shoes because they don't quite fit my minimal capsule wardrobe. But, that is not their fault really, and I feel the make of the shoe plus the many rave reviews speak to their durability. Ideally, I would love to find a shoe that wears like Samba Classics but is minimal with a simple shape and less adornment.<br/><br/>Thought they would work but ultimately their style just didn't fit."
"adidas The only reason I don't like these shoes is b/c I have extremely flat feet. I had no idea there's such a high arch in these. It's almost like I'm standing on a bubble or a small ball. Very uncomfortable. Disappointed b/c I have wanted a pair of these for some time. The size is true, the width is somewhat narrow, and the color and quality is nice."
"adidas Received shoes in a timely manner. Look great as expected. However, there was no official Adidas tag in the first shoelace hole of either shoe (which usually comes on new Adidas).  This made me a bit weary. Perhaps they were a returned item from someone who found them narrow? Enjoy the shoe overall."
adidas this is like my 12th set - love these shoes
adidas Good quality shoe.
"adidas Shoes arrived on-time (thanks Amazon Prime).<br/>I wore them for six miles right out of the box and my feet didn't hurt once. In fact, it was like walking on clouds.<br/>I have flat feet and normally wear Vans, so I was a bit skeptical about how the arch support would feel, but it's much appreciated.<br/>I got the white color and they look so crisp- I get a lot of compliments on them."
adidas Just like the pair I had in 1988.  Love them!
adidas Size does not match my older pair.
"adidas Great shoe, great quality. I'm usually a size US 8.5 and that's what I ordered. They fit as expected with the insoles they come with but I use my own insoles and that caused them to be a bit narrow towards the toes. I also wear Asics Gel Kayano's in the same size with my insoles and the Asics fit great - so these Samba's are a bit narrow compared to other shoes in the same size. The insoles they come with are also a bit thin and don't offer much in the way of cushioning. Overall highly recommend these shoes."
adidas Love it. Highly recommended and so culty product!!!
"adidas This is one shoe that came in with the kind of high quality I was expecting. It's very comfortable on my foot, soft inside and above all very stylish. But I only worry is that I got a much larger size 11.5 that leaves a lot more space in front of my foot. I should have ordered the size 11 instead. But I'm not too much worried about it. I will recommend this product to anyone who is stylish and want to look sporty. I will rate this shoe 5 stars."
"adidas These are my third pair in the past 3 years. I also have a couple of pairs of Nike indoor shoes. We play indoor soccer twice a week for about 2 hours each day, so I wear them out rather quickly. I like Samba because these pairs provide great traction and stability, and it is difficult to roll my ankle when I wear these. I am 54 years old, and safety is most important to me."
"adidas This is my 8th pair...I was a little concerned that something had changed because of some of the other poster comments whihc I now disagree with!  They are great for work when you can wear jeans and they provide great support for my feet.  When I initially got them they were tight but I remembered I had to open the shoe strings up and then tighten them when the foot was in.  As usual, it took a couple of days to break them in but I just love them!"
"adidas Good shoes.  I've wore these shoes 20+ years ago.  Liked them then, still like them.  I will continue to buy these and wear them."
"adidas Great shoes, wearing them right now. They look cool and feel better"
adidas We love the style! It's a real classic.
adidas fantastic shoes!
adidas These are great leather shoes.
"adidas I had to order these 1/2 size smaller than I usually wear. The arch supports were way too high for me, so I just removed the insoles and peeled off the foam strip under the arches. Now they feel great. I'll probably take the insoles out when I use them for weightlifting."
"adidas I have wanted these shoes since I was 7 years old.  I am now 33 and I finally got a pair.  Overall I like these shoes, but they seem to fit a little snug.  I wear a men's 13 (huge I know) and I don't have super wide feet.  It does seem that the more I wear them the more comfortable they get, so I recommend them."
adidas This is my husband's second pair of these shoes and he loves them. They last for a couple of years even if constant wear. The style is great and looks great with any style.
"adidas Looks very stylish and made of nice material, but the fit was a little big. I usually wear 13's and that's what I bought, but probably would have been better off with a 12.5, maybe even a 12.<br/><br/>Also, the tongue is really big. Not sure if that's a style choice or what. It's not obnoxiously big, but takes some getting used to."
adidas Great classic shoe. Very comfortable!
adidas Sambas are still awesome. This is probably the 10 pair he's owned.
adidas Fits really snug for my size. Cut tongue down because it was uncomfortable and now I'm really enjoying the shoe!
adidas Very nice looking shoe and not a bad price.
"adidas I've been purchasing Samba's for about 10 years now, but usually from Kohl's. This was my first time purchasing from Amazon. The shoe fits extremely tightly compared to my previous purchases.<br/><br/>Maybe I just need to break them in a bit more, but I'm a bit in pain after an entire workday wearing them"
adidas Length size as expected. Narrow width especially at toes
"adidas These are the best shoes that I have ever owned - I bought my first pair 6 years ago and just purchased my third pair last week.  I wear them every day...  I am a father of 3 young boys and I wear these shoes all day long chasing my kids all over the place!  Some reviewers have stated that the shoes tend to ""squeak"" when wearing them, but I have never had that issue with any pair that I have owned.<br/><br/>Light, comfortable and extremely durable - nothing comes close..."
"adidas Too narrow in the toe box, so I had to return."
"adidas The length is fine, but the insole has a half arched shape in the middle that makes the width feel tighter than normal and the shoes aren't very comfortable because of it.  I decided to keep them instead of return them because I got them really cheap and they look great, and I can tolerate them if I'm only wearing them for a few hours or so.  I did end up buying some Pumas that are very similar and had a flat insole and were much more comfortable."
"adidas At age 51, I ordered my first pair of these since I was a soccer player in high school.  They remain incredibly comfortable and stylish looking, whether worn with low cut socks or barefoot.  Caution: the arch supports are really high in these shoes, and may take some getting used to.  However, they make your feet feel great at the end of the day.  I don't wear them to play soccer, but they work great as both a walking shoe and as an everyday run around shoe.  Highly recommended."
adidas I purchased a pair of these for my son to youth ref &amp; play soccer on an indoor pitch. The stitching has come out on the top seems within 4mos of purchasing.<br/><br/>He loves the shoes otherwise.
"adidas High quality shoe for the price. My last paired lasted over 5 years of continued use and abuse. The sole finally wore through the balls of the feet so had to get another pair. I usually wear 11.5 in most shoes, purchased 12 in these and fit perfect."
"adidas I have been wear thins same style of show since HS.  LOVE them always comfortable and last forever, well not forever obviously since I have bought like 5 pair in my lifetime, but last a long time.<br/><br/>great for running around, playing indoor soccer and always stylish!!"
adidas It is very high quality shoe. It seems to last for a long period of time but i am going to return it because it hurts my toes on the left leg. Maybe it is personal but I experience this problem. And it is also a little rough. So if you like soft (like socks) shoe it is not for you.
"adidas I bought a 6.4 to fit a Women's 8.5 and it was way too big. Other than that, nice shoes"
"adidas Great looking and comfortable shoe if it fits probably. I ordered a 10 because every pair of Sambas I've had was a size 10, these fit a bit to small on the front of my foot. I will order a 10.5 with these. Hoping they fit better."
"adidas Nothing beats the classic.  I attempted a switch to the samba millenium a few years ago after wearing the samba classics in highschool and i have to say i don't regret going back to the original. the samba millenium just couldn't provide the same feel and not to mention quality, associated with the samba classic.  Add to that the samba classic is relatively less expensive.<br/><br/>As with the case of the timeless copa mundials, despite the availability of more ""advanced"" designs out there, it pays to stick with what works.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this shoe as it gives you a timeless look and overall comfort and feel, whether you're wearing it for casual walk arounds or if you're using it for some indoor play, you can't go wrong with the classic."
adidas These have been great for indoor soccer and have held up so far this season.  It did take a while to train the tongue to stay folded over (if that's the way you like to wear them).<br/>My indoor field is thick turf and I've had no traction issues.
"adidas It's probably the difference in my feet,  it the arch in the right shoe is tall and a bit uncomfortable. Also my fault, but I thought I ordered white on black not the reverse. Oh well, I'm doing this old school."
adidas These are the best shoes I have ever owned. Super comfortable with great arch support. Lasted me about 3 years of daily abuse. I found the size needed to be a half size less than I normally wear. I recommend trying them on first if you've never had them before.
"adidas TL;DR: Great shoes, will mold to fit you like a glove, and last for at least a year of heavy use. Get the Samba Originals if you prefer a short tongue.<br/><br/>About me: I'm on my fourth pair of Samba Classics. In a row. I love this shoe, and I think you will too. That being said, here's what I think you need to know:<br/><br/>I first started wearing these shoes because I needed something with a flat sole to dance in (I did musicals in high school, and I wore straight through a pair of running shoes), and I fell completely in love with them. I wear them 100% of the time when it isn't raining and there isn't snow on the ground. I have also worn them for their ""intended purpose"" - indoor soccer - and find they work great there too.<br/><br/>I would DEFINITELY recommend these shoes for serious walking, dancing, or indoor soccer. NOTE WELL: they will mold to your feet as if you were born wearing them, and will change their appearance somewhat once broken in (the leather will look a lot less shiny, and will develop a flatter fit across your foot), in my opinion much for the better. Like all leather shoes, these have a break in period, and I find it's less than a week. Once broken in, they feel AWESOME, and last a very long time: my last three pairs lasted between 1 year and 1.5 years each, depending on the amount of walking I did (walking increased when I went to college). They're also very comfortable walking / standing shoes. I've never gotten blisters or pains from them.<br/><br/>I would NOT recommend these shoes for rain, snow, ice, hiking, or serious running. The flat sole, which makes them great for traction on flat, dry surfaces, falls short on all of these things. Since they are leather, they're fairly water resistant, and a coat of water repellent spray will make them very water resistant (and avoid winter salt water stains), but water WILL get in around the tongue, which is not attached at the sides, only at the front.<br/><br/>These shoes tend to wear in two places: the interior heel (the back of the inside lining), which will develop holes if you're a fan of slipping your shoes on and off (which I don't recommend: these are leather, they're meant to be tied snug); and the sole, which will gradually wear toward smooth. I find that the sole and the upper wear at about the same rate: i.e. by the time the sole is worn to the point of noticeable slippage on wet surfaces, the shoes themselves look like they're ready to be replaced. If you don't care about these two factors (or you want a pair of old shoes to work in), they will basically last forever. I still use my first pair for construction, painting, and mowing the lawn. They're over four years old and the leather will probably outlast everything else in my life.<br/><br/>These shoes are essentially identical to the Samba Originals, the difference being that these have a longer tongue. Some people don't like the tongue, which is reminiscent of soccer cleats, but I like it because it makes the shoes pop a bit more, and goes well with long casual pants, with which you can wear the tongue outside of the pants (the tongue is also not uncomfortable with shorts, especially after it gets bent forward a bit by being worn with long pants)."
adidas Product is fine. But size was not comfortable.
"adidas I've been wearing Adidas Samba shoes for over 7 years. This is a great shoe for my particular feet. The tongue, however, is way too long on this version. All in all still a very comfortable shoe."
adidas love it
adidas Love these shoes. We buy a pair every 2 or 3 years as they are the shoes I wear 80% of the time. They hold up very well. Great quality product. They are a perfect fit. You can't go wrong with these shoes. Always cheaper to buy them on Amazon.
"adidas Classic style. My favorite sneakers by far and I have many many pairs of others. Slip resistant, nice arch support, can be laced up for support or left loose for convenience. I used to ear these on turf for soccer, and continued to ear them skateboarding (some people don't like the arch while skating but I personally did)."
"adidas Odd, I liked the look of soccer shoes and that they were for indoor soccer meant no cleats. I just didn't notice the outsized tongue. Is that a common feature of soccer shoes? They're a bit clownish.<br/><br/>Other than that, they're ok."
"adidas My husband has been wearing Sambas for as long as I have known him. In the almost decade we've been together, he's gone through a few pairs. (He tends to wear them all day, everyday.) When his pair finally starts to wear out too much and I ask him what shoes he wants next, he goes right back to these. I guess that says it all!"
"adidas They put some kind of lump on the arch that kills my feet if I stand in these things for too long. And if I don't sinch the laces just right they end up pinching the tops of my feet. Kinda weird really that a shoe like this that's been around so long has these weird problems with design.<br/>Anyway, in terms of style they can't be beat. So you get a cool look but sacrifice a bit on the comfort front. I'm thinking about getting some new inserts to replace the stock ones. Maybe they'll be better after that."
"adidas Love the classic look, comfy fit, and arch support. There are two styles one with a larger tongue and good support, and another style with a short tongue and flatter bottom. Make sure you are ordering the correct one! I've been ordering these for years and they never disappoint."
adidas One of the best shoes ever made! Comfortable and fits as expected. I will buy these as long as they make them. They last very long too. I just bought my second white pair after my first white pair of 9 years finally came apart. I would recommend this to anyone!
"adidas No matter what shoe you put up against, the Adidas Samba will always be the better shoe!!"
adidas nice
adidas I have a slightly different version of this shoe and bought these for my son. We play handball a few times a week and he put holes in his while mine still look almost new. I'm going to get him the exact shoe I order and see if it's him or the shoe.
"adidas Fit is good, very comfortable.  Biggest concern was a little bit of residue left from the toe, leaving white marks on things.<br/><br/>I use them in the gym for squats and deadlift, the flat sole is perfect and doesn't deform under even heavy weight. Great stability, and excellent look."
"adidas Arch is a bit high at first. I'm used to the Originals, but I've worn the Classics in some and am liking them more."
"adidas These were a gift for my son who totally loves these shoes, has owned them before and wanted another pair. He's crazy about them. Says they have a great arch support and fit perfectly. I ordered him size 10 that's his normal shoe size."
"adidas Great quality shoe, nice shoes, look great, great pricing as well. BUT the sole of the shoe is extremely narrow, and I'm sure over time the shoe will break in however right away my foot is hanging over the side of the rubber and I don't consider my foot to be extremely wide, but they're good shoes."
"adidas I've been wearing Sambas off and on for 20 years.  Bought these to serve as a more supportive casual shoe than the Chuck Taylors I usually wear.  The arch support in the right shoe is fine, but in the left shoe, the arch hits too far forward on my foot.  Never had this problem with past pairs. Not sure if the design has changed, or if it's just the pair I bought."
adidas These are classics. Fit very comfortable even for wide feet. I think they might run just a tad bit small so I ordered a alf size bigger and that did the trick.
"adidas I'm a size 11.5 with a wide foot, ordered size 12, just like a prior pair i owned.  These shoes are way too tight, will need to return them."
adidas Totally satisfied...!!
"adidas I purchased these for my wife so she could do do deadlifts, squats, oly lifts, etc.  They are less expensive than proprietary lifting shoes, but provide a nice, hard, stiff, flat sole for a solid lifting platform.  My wife says she likes them and they do what she needs them to do.  She has been wearing them for about a month or two and has had no issues."
"adidas Love the shoe.  I had to remove that insole, as detailed in other reviews, to make them fit comfortably."
"adidas Nice looking, make sure you realize how long the tongue is. If you want a shorter tongue, there's a different model you can buy."
adidas I joined an indoor soccer team and needed some shoes.  I got them within 2 days thanks to prime and they were exactly as expected.  The arch was a touch high for my feet but after 20 minutes my feet had acclimated to the change.
adidas Love it
adidas I am usually in between sizes 8.5/9 in women's so I ordered a men's 7 to be on the safe side.  Shoes fit perfect as expected &amp; I've been wearing them ever since they were delivered.
adidas These shoes used to be better but now they suck and run too small had to return them wife said they looked stupid too first thing I ever returned from Amazon
"adidas Stylish, extremely comfortable - a great everyday sneaker"
"adidas I wear a size 13 and these are a bit too big (by about 1/2 in). Other than that I LOVE these shoes. They're tough, durable and great for a combination running and weightlifting shoe. The price was also great for such a good shoe."
"adidas Stylish and very comfortable. This is the model with the long tongue (which I normally fold under itself), which has considerably more arch support and cushioning than the shorter tongued version. They're a little narrow in the toe, but not extremely so. Well built and durable."
"adidas Good casual shoes but kind of narrow, once you break into them they're quite comfortable though. Squeakiness seems to go away once you break into them as well. Arch support is meh or about average. Love the look of it though, not too shabby..... not too shabby at all. 3.5/5 if I could rate it."
"adidas Almost 20 years ago, I would jealously admire the Sambas that the other students' wore. Now that I'm an adult, I figured it was time to buy myself a pair. Absolutely no regrets. I'm pleasantly surprised that there is some arch support (so I'm not sure how the flat-footed would fare) but they are very comfortable. I also think they're a lot nicer looking than other sneakers, so I can sometimes get away with wearing them with my nicer business casual outfits. Now I want the other colors."
"adidas These are my go-to shoes, and they remain such.  They're great all day long, look classy, feel marvelous, and fit well.  Only drawback is how quickly the backend inside the shoes wears out.  It always wears away and pills off, so that within several months of wearing these (not cheap) shoes, I will need to buy a new pair or make repairs to the old ones."
"adidas These shoes are okay... they tend to be very tight around the outside of my feet,  and cause some pain while  running.  I've used these for 4- 45 minute sessions so far,  so may need broken in a bit more.<br/>I don't remember this ever being a problem with sambas in the past."
"adidas bought these for my 11 year old son and he says they are very uncomfortable. I tried them on (we happen to be the same size at the moment) and yes, they are very uncomfortable. :/ too bad because I really like the style."
"adidas I like the shows, especially the look.  I they are a bit narrow at the toes.  Had I know this I might have gone up half a size.  Also, the have large arches that make them uncomfortable.  I've been wearing them for a couple days and it seems to be getting better.  I'm not sure if my shoe is breaking in, my foot is just getting used to it, or some combination of both.  Overall I'm happy with the purchase."
adidas My husband has had the same style of shoe for the last 8 years. I always keep coming back to get him new ones every year! Love them!
"adidas I've worn these for many years, from when I actually engaged in football (soccer) to just walking the dogs.  Everyone has different ideas about shoes, so your mileage may vary.  But for me these are comfortable, durable, and a real bargain."
adidas Great gym shoes. ADIDAS never fails to surprise me.
adidas so classy and perfect.
"adidas I love the shoe and the size is fine but the arch is a bit much. I can feel it in the middle of my feet. I don't play soccer anymore so I bought them just to wear around. I have big wide feet with not much of an arch. It's okay though, I will break them in. Thank you for a great classic shoe."
"adidas These have all the same classic samba styling, but without the biggest problem witht the newer Sambas, the squeaking.  I have previously had 2 pairs that would squeak constantly while I walk, these do not.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is that the long tongue has rubbed against my ankles before on long walks (30,000 steps in NYC) and caused small sores."
adidas Love these shoes and plan to just buy more as I wear them out. I had to rip the arch support out under the insole because it was a bit to intense but after that these are quality shoes for deadlifts or everyday wear
adidas Super comfy.  Haven't changed in years.  Hold up to a lot of abuse.
adidas They look great. I'm a 10 in nikes. A 9.5 in vans. A 10 was great in the Sambas. Sometimes I fold the tongue in so the whole thing isn't showing and that can get a little uncomfortable on the top of my foot. When I leave it as is they are very comfortable and look great.
"adidas Samba Classics are the best shoe, no doubt. I've been wearing them as my everyday shoe for years running now. I just buy a pair, wear through them, buy another, and continue. The first 3 days breaking them in are uncomfortable after which you are rewarded with the most comfortable shoe there is. They are also one of the most minimalist shoes giving you great feel through it into whatever you might be trying to do with your foot, driving and such.<br/><br/>Due to the minimalist nature, they aren't necessarily the most supportive shoe in the arch or heel padding. Know that going in, find a good insert to couple with them, and you will never want to get a different shoe as your everyday again. I suggest a 1/2-3/4 length insert as this does not alter the toe compartment thereby leaving you room there and also the feel of your toes through the bottom of the shoe."
adidas My son loves Adidas Sambas!  I buy him the same shoes every year for his birthday and they always last until the next year.  Not this pair!  It started to split on the top and holes developed in the sole within 2 weeks of wearing them!
adidas My husband wore them one time and the sole is coming apart already.
"adidas So like so other reviews, this is my first pair of sambas and they are a little snug.  I've always been told I have a narrow foot so it seems strange these fit tight.  The length of the shoe is good so I don't want to increase the size and I plan to give these a few weeks to break in and see how they feel.  I'm not sure if I can post a follow up review, but if I can I will in a few weeks."
adidas I actually purchased this shoe as a gift. She wears an 8.5 in women so I thought this size would fit fine. The issue with this shoe is that it didn't fit true to size. It was small to be a 6.5 Men size. The inseam at the top of the foot is narrow and she said it cinched the back of her foot even with thin socks on (this was after she walked around in them for about 10 minutes). I haven't had any problems with adidas so I tried them on and she wasn't lying. As far as appearance you're definitely getting your classic Samaba!(this shoe has the long tongue also and I did'nt notice that when I purchased them).
adidas Gift for hubby. Classic - always fits
"adidas I recommend you remove the white foam under the soles for more arch comfort. Aside from that, the shoes are great. I wear a 10 in Nikes and got these in a 9.5 and they fit perfectly!"
"adidas I got my first pair of Sambas when I was 13, and they lasted 9 years. And I'm a soccer player, so they certainly saw their use. Durable, comfortable, and classy, this is a terrific purchase for the casual kick-around at the park or a serious afternoon on the pitch. The leather upper is really comfortable. The only downside is the massive tongue, which has a tendency to either a.) look goofy or b.) rub against your ankle when you walk. But this Samba won't squeak when you walk, so it's worth it.<br/><br/>If you're on the fence, just do it. You won't regret it. And you'll always have a shoe that feels good to wear to class, to the gym, or out to eat."
"adidas Excellent shoe, been wearing them for years. As much as I put them through, the bottoms last about a year (on turf, grass, gym floor &amp; concrete). Only issue...price. Last pair purchased Sept 2016 was $10 cheaper."
"adidas So far the arch support hasn't bother me at all, like other guys mention. The shoes are very flexible, I thought they were going to be somewhat stiff, but so far they are very good, I'm even considering to buy the black ones too, but I'll wait longer. I know this model since the late 70's, and I have always liked it."
"adidas They fit as expected but are snug so if you prefer a little wiggle room, then size up .5.  Overall, great shoe...the classic."
adidas Got them for a deal for ~$20.  Was a great purchase!  The arch in the shoe is insane - Definitely takes some hours to break them in and adjust to them.  But Sambas are classic indoor soccer shoes for a reason!  And you could wear these casually with jeans too.
adidas The shoes fits great and feels great. The only thing was the arch suppprt was bothering me so took off the insole. It sounds like it's rippin but it's only the glue. There's a white foam piece that easily peels off and then replace the insole. It's a quick fix and the shoe is perfect now.
"adidas The Adidas Men's Samba Classic Soccer shoe are still very well made.  I had my previous pair for well over 10 years until they finally gave out on me, so I bought another pair and they still look and feel great!"
adidas Great shoes.... strange shipping though.... I got an email saying they had shipped that day ... less than 5 minutes later I heard the door bell ring it was Fed-Ex with the shoes.... I though wow that was weird!
"adidas They were okay. Really good shoes when I first got them but they degraded in quality quickly (about 3-4 months). Very disappointing to me as I did not even use these to play in a local league, but just for a pick up match a week with my friends."
adidas My husband complains of back pain after walking in these for about 20 mins.
"adidas If you have wide feet like I do, it's going to take a while to stretch these out to where they're comfortable. That being said once they're stretched they are quite comfortable, and last a long time. Next time I might to with kangaroo leather shoes since they're softer."
adidas It's very comfortable
"adidas The price is great and they're holding up pretty well so far, fits like any other Adidas I've worn and I've worn a lot. Not the epitome of comfort and the high tongue takes a little getting used to, but overall a great value in the shoe world. I've even done some light running in them with no issues. Good all purpose shoe."
"adidas I bought the same shoe in black color about 10 years ago and have been very happy with the quality and comfort. The quality of the new Samba shoes in white appears to be ok. However, they are considerably smaller. The length is still ok but they are way too narrow for me. I had to return them."
adidas Very comfortable straight out of the box. I didn't have to worry about breaking them in. I've worn them for a few games already and they are still looking brand new. I would buy these again if I needed new pair!!!
adidas Love these shoes. They're comfortable and didn't take much for breaking in. I mainly got them for the way they look. Extremely cute - especially for someone who has a hard time finding a shoe that fits well. the price was right and I use them almost on a daily basis.
adidas My son has worn these same shoes for 3 years now(in different sizes of course!). They are comfy and durable!
adidas Good shoes. Didn't have chance to play indoor soccer yet but I wear it everyday when I go out.
"adidas This is my second pair of Sambas.  Very comfy shoe.  It either has more arch support than past models or my old Samba's were that worn out.  Either way, I like the shoes for any indoor sport played on turf!"
"adidas adidas shoes ive notice, youve got to go down half a size but for my every day shoe the slightly larger fit is fine.<br/><br/>unless you want to play soccer in them they dont need to be super tight/fit like that"
"adidas I bought  these as I wanted to relive my high school days where the cool shoe back then was the samba. I got a lot compliments of going old school when I wore these to work. Good fit. Great classic shoe that hasn't changed in ovER 20 years. I am sure this is meant as more of an indoor soccer shoe, but they are comfortable and have a good loon as well"
adidas such a cool retro pair of sneakers! I love them
adidas Very uncomfortable. Had to return the product.
adidas Best shoes around!
"adidas The shoes fit well and were what we expected, but the Adidas box came so torn up and ripped apart. I would expect the box to be intact. As soon as I took it out of the package, the box just fell apart."
"adidas They are comfortable, look great and seem to have pretty solid build quality. I love the raised arch support, but I think thats subjective. If you are sensitive to that be warned that it's a pretty significant hump underneath your arch.<br/><br/>That being said, I do wish I hadn't ripped the tags off before wearing them. They are almost a whole size too large for me, to the point where if I hadn't stuffed the toebox they would slip off my feet."
"adidas Good comfortable shoe for walking. Incredible foot support and comfortable. Width is good on these compared to other Adidas which tend to be a little on the narrower side. The tongue does look like soccer shin guards which I did not pay attention to, but the comfort makes up for it."
"adidas Have worn Samba's for years. I will always have at least two pair in my house. One old pair that fit like slippers, and one new pair being broke in. I think I am on my eleventh and twelveth pair right now."
adidas I really lucked out with this find! Totally satisfied!
"adidas Excellent shoe, in my opinion. Wore Sambas from way back being a former soccer player. This pair is for everyday wear and love the white. Kick up your style few notches with this shoe!"
"adidas Shoe is well constructed and looks pretty good. I would definitely buy one size larger than what you regularly wear. I am a size 13, but I got a size 14 after reading the other reviews, and the size 14 fits me perfectly. My only complaint is that the arch support takes some getting used to, after a decade of wearing flat, ""skater"" shoes. At first it is pretty uncomfortable until you get used to it and the shoe is worn in."
"adidas This is not the first pair of Sambas that I have worn. As always they are comfortable to wear all day. Durable regardless of the intense stress in any surface. As long as they continue making it, I'll continue buying it."
adidas I have never considered that I have wide feet but these fit too tight. It has been 1 month and I thought they would stretch since they are made of leather but they are still uncomfortable. I recommend getting 1/2 size larger than usual.
"adidas Samba's are great casual shoes and have been around forever. I don't use them for sports but for walking short distances, arch support isnt the best and cushioning is not like a running shoe. The design has been around since the 1960's so don't expect them to be too ""cushy."""
adidas Love Sambas. These were great. Very comfortable and good arch support. Great shoe.
"adidas These run a bit narrow compared to my last pair. But, as I wear a EE, it should not matter to most."
"adidas I've purchased this shoe on and off for 30 years! All have been champs! This pair: not so good. Less than five months of wear and the inside heel of the right shoe is almost completely shredded. Not sure why. If the next pair goes that way, we're done!"
"adidas these sambas are as good as a time machine! when i put them on, i become that long-haired, punk rock, grunge soccer player that i was in high school - the bad-ass is back! the sambas make me better looking, more athletic and smooth as a baby's bottom with the ladies... but don't tell my wife or she won't let me wear them anymore.<br/><br/>the only shoes that give the samba any challenge in the ""rad"" department are some classic all-stars. wear either and you'll hear people shouting ""day-um, those are some fresh kicks"" as you swagger down the road!"
"adidas The most comfortable shoe of any kind I have ever worn. I have worn Sambas for both competition and recreation for 30 years, buying a new pair when the old ones finally wear out (which takes quite a while). Love these shoes."
"adidas Somewhat small to begin with, but does stretch. The long tongue is a bit uncomfortable for my son."
"adidas be careful, there are two 'mens samba' adidas shoes on here, these ones have a bump in the arch that the other sambas do not.  its not the worst thing in the world, but it is a bit unexpected and annoying."
adidas the tongue is different than on my suede sambas.  The leather ones have ridiculously large tongues that look like they're suppposed to fold back down over the laces or something but they aren't.  Not a fan of the look.
adidas Awesome shoes. I had the black ones already. These are just as cool. Now I have both black and white. They fit perfectly. Good for casual wear and they are also made for soccer play so you'll be ready for a battle no matter where you go.!
"adidas I would recommend this show to anyone who doesn't have wide feet.  My feet are a little wide but I have never felt they wouldn't fit in a shoe because the shoe was too narrow but this one i right on the border.<br/><br/>I like the shoe tho! other than being narrow it is comfortable, the tongue covers the laces really well and the shoe overall is flexible."
"adidas Good shoes, however there is a built in arch support that if you do not have a high arch can take some getting used to.  I could only stand walking around in them for about an two to three hours, but after two weeks of wearing them in they much more comfortable.  Great pair of shoes l, will probaby buy again once these wear out."
"adidas I love these shoes.  Classic looks, classic feel, decent price point.  Probably my 18th pair since college when I played indoor soccer."
"adidas Classic samba are great for you if you have arched feet not flat foot. Someone wrote a review earlier about classic v originals and it is true. Classic is more for arch support and tongue is larger. This is a benefit for me because I do have arched foot and the tongue helps out a lot in terms of slipping on and off the shoe instead of re-tie my shoe every time I wear it. Shipment was fast and after wearing this for over 3 months, still comfy and barely wear on tear after wearing it every day. Great shoe to wear and highly recommended."
"adidas As a former soccer player of ten years,  I still like the look and feel of this shoe. I wear my newer ones to work, as casual wear and I have a pair for around the yard. They are priced reasonable and the shipping is quick. I give them a 5 for style, workmanship and price. I feel wearing the white or black Adidas samba will set you apart, as a fashion statement. Enjoy your shoes!"
adidas Fit great. Long tong takes time to get use to.
"adidas I love adidas and will always wear them, but for some reason this shoe leather is not relaxing.  I do tend to have a wide foot that is where this shoe is narrow, overall length is right wear I would want it in my size.  This is also the first time I have felt the arch support in a pair of shoes in a very long time."
"adidas It's a classic shoe, a good amount of people are probably out wearing it wherever you are now. I've used to exclusively wear skate shoes (Vans Classics and the such), and when I got these shoes it was definitely a step up in construction. However they do tend to fit more narrow and the build supports it. Took about a week to break in and now they fit comfortably."
"adidas Boyfriend absolutely loves this pair of shoes. He wears them almost exclusively, having had several pairs in the past."
adidas bought these for my son in college to replace his existing pair that he has worn non stop for several years and loves. They fit perfectly and he was able to step into them and keep on going.
adidas look really nice
adidas The huge tongue felt weird at first but I got used to it. Pretty good overall.
adidas My husband was thrilled with the shoes. He has wanted a pair for a long time!!
"adidas Needed a pair of cheap casual looking shoes that I could wear with just about anything, these were it. I originally tried the  Samba 'Original' shoe but found that they were more narrow than I had liked and they squeaked alot when I walked. I took those back and tried the Samba 'Classic' and loved how they fit. They are better for a wider foot because they 'give' more than the 'Original' in my opinion. The tongue is really long but you can fold it down if you want, not a big deal for me but may be for others. Overall, nice shoe and worth the cash."
"adidas Such a comfortable and stylish shoe. Provides amazing arch support and comfort as well as style. You can wear it with sporty outfit or skirt and leather jacket, very versatile! My dad has had Sambas for years, and his last pair lasted about 10 years. Amazing buy."
adidas These shoes are super comfortable and also very cheap!  I normally wear 12EE shoes but I bought these at 12.5 because  knew that they were narrow.  I wear these all day at the office and they are great.  I leave the laces very loose so they slip on.
"adidas I bought the old style trying to avoid the squeaky issue from the newer design - but I didn't realize how Mick Jagger-esque long the tongue on these would be.  I usually use really short socks so the tongue rubs on my upper foot, not a huge deal but I've had to dig out older, longer socks to accommodate."
"adidas The arches on these are really ""tall"" for some reason. It feels like there's a big round rock in the bottom of sole on these guys. Maybe they just don't fit my feel that well but I don't wear them often because of it."
"adidas The service was great and I love Samba's but I haven't worn these for like 20 years and they fit a bit different. I might exchange for a half  size up, I haven't decided yet. I n might just need to get n used to them."
"adidas Nice shoes, nicer price."
"adidas I really really like the design and colors first off.  It's a classic samba so of course it looks fantastic!  I bought size 10 and I wear a size 10, and the fit is perfect.  I haven't tested these out on the court yet but I've used them for just casual shoe hanging around with friends.<br/>They're a bit on the narrow side, and I have wide feet so I'm hoping they'll adapt to the form of my feet over time.<br/>They also have a nice padded area in the shoe for the arch of your foot which feels great and keep you feet feeling comfortable walking or running."
"adidas I ordered the shoes in a size 8 because I called the adidas company and asked what size shoe I should get in men's since I'm a 8.5 in women's.... well I placed the order and thought that the shoes would be to big so I emailed the company later that night and they changed it! Shoes were shipped the 30th I literally received next day when I got basic shipping,  I'm overly satisfied with my shoes and they fit great especially for skinny feet haha!"
"adidas I bought these for my son, we saw them elsewhere for a higher price.  Only complaint would be that the tongue hangs out quite a bit, though in hindsight that is obvious from the picture."
adidas Same sambas I remember from ten years ago. After walking around the block with my dog they were quite comfy again.
"adidas I was tempted to return these during the first week, but after a bit of a break-in period, they're quite comfortable.  They seem to be holding up well, with no visible stitching issues."
adidas These shoes are classic. Everyone needs a pair of these. Inches closer to the dad shoe look.<br/><br/>I can wear them around town and the office. And I even use these to workout in if I forgot to bring my other shoes!
"adidas Favorite soccer/gym/classic shoe ever. Been wearing it daily for about a year and it still look brand new. Played indoor/outdoor soccer with it, lifted weights with it, and i wear to the gym 6 days a week, i run with it, and i also wear it to school almost everyday."
"adidas No indoor soccer shoe matches this quality with this price. They go for quality over sleekness and weight. They are very thick and don't breath well, but performance makes up for it. I've had four pair of these shoes and will probably always have a pair on hand."
adidas Early Christmas present for my SO. Perfect!
adidas Very comfortable shoes you can use all around. The shoe runs a half size larger however. My Adidas's neo are 8 1/2 however the size 8 fits me perfect. Plus I haven't seen anyone with these exact same shoes I have been getting compliments
"adidas These shoes are slightly narrower across the arch than other shoes, but otherwise fit well and are comfortable."
"adidas Well constructed shoe. My other pair are still going strong after 3 years with only some scuffs due to my own clumsy walking. They have a small arch support which is welcome for me, as I cannot walk long in completely flat shoes."
"adidas I always get these! Usually in the normal black and white, this time I changed it up and went white and black, totally different look with the same feel and style! Love it sooo much!"
adidas Exactly  what I wanted at a Great price. Box was a little beat up though. Would order again from this company.
"adidas Been wearing Sambas for 45 years, always a great product never, vary in size. Very comfortable, I have multiple pairs in both homes, older ines for working in and new for going out."
"adidas These are one of my favorite shoes ever made!!! I have 4 pairs of Samba's but I didn't have the actual indoor soccer classic Samba's. They are a great shoe for work or just as an everyday sneaker and they last forever!!! The classics do have a difference then the other Samba's the tongue of the shoe is extra long like on a soccer cleat, it doesn't bother me I like the look but some people may think its a little weird. They are a little stiff until you break them in, but after that they are super comfortable!!!"
adidas Great condition. Wear these a lot. I have wide feet and they fit perfectly. I'm a size 8 to 8 1/2 in women's and got a size 7 in men's and thet fit great.
adidas Nice sporty shoes. The dirt on the suede comes off pretty easily for the most part. They are a tiny bit tight on the sides of my feet but I have wide feet and I'm sure these will stretch out. I have plantar fasciitis and my feet hurt less in these shows so that is also a bonus. This is probably due to them being standard and narrow- helps to keep my hurt foot together.
adidas Awesome! They are a present for my son.
"adidas These shoes changed my life forever! I have lower back problems and the high arch support and general comfyness of the shoe abolished my back pain from standing/walking all day. In addition to being comfortable, they are sexy. This is the second pair of these that I have bought (the old ones lasted years of near daily use) and I will buy the next pair when this one becomes worn in another few years.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the tongue is too long - easily fixed with scissors and a sewing needle! ;)"
adidas Use these for work. Built strong and last long. It's my fourth pair why look for something else when your happy with it. Will buy agin I where a 12.5 in adidas and a 13 in nikes.
"adidas Perfect, My son loves this style, been wearing them for years, he is 32 years old. Great comfortable shoe"
adidas I dont play soccer but i just might start.
adidas Fave brand of shoes. Fit great.
"adidas Great shoes, good look, very comfortable. The soles do wear out a little faster than other sneakers (technically, the rubber soles are better suited for indoor soccer than every-day-wear).<br/><br/>There should be a ""subscribe-and-save"" option, because I'll keep wearing 'em as long as they make 'em!"
adidas Great shoes. Very comfortable. But best when you remove the excessive arch support from the inner sole.
"adidas For those in a hurry...<br/>PROS: Style, material quality, traction.<br/>CONS: Too narrow, hurts foot a lot.<br/><br/>Used to own a pair of Sambas when they were manufactured in Indonesia. Best shoe I have ever owned. This new one, which is supposedly manufactured in Vietnam, looks just as great! However, it just doesn't fit correctly on the wide part of the foot between the arch and your toes. It is way too narrow and hurts a lot.<br/><br/>Other reviews complained about the narrowness, but I figured they didn't give the shoes a chance. I thought that maybe, like cleats, I just needed to ""break them in."" The first day it hurt a lot, but I put up with it. The second day it hurt a little bit less, so I thought maybe it was getting better. The third day it hurt more than the first two days...so I said forget it...I have to return them. Also, loosening them doesn't help either.<br/><br/>It was a tough decision because they used to be amazing shoes: unmatched traction, perfect style. However, it's not worth messing up your feet. They really need to fix the fit-design and I'll give them another try in a few years."
adidas Looks good
"adidas I loved my older style Sambas, and wish that I could say the same thing about this new pair.  There is nothing inherently wrong with them, but they do not fit nearly as well, feel slightly heavier, with less arch support."
"adidas Fits well, comfortable. I have yet to try them for soccer purposes, but if my review changes I will update it accordingly"
"adidas Best shoes I've ever owned. Comfortable, relaxed and most of all I look great in them. Ready for fetish week in Berlin"
adidas I've bought both types of colors on these classic sambas. I have the more modern ones but those aren't so tuff as these sambas. Really comfortable shoes for a son or for a person. I love these shoes because these are the most comfortable indoor soccer shoes
"adidas Great shoes. This is my second pair. Only complaint is I wish they had a smaller tongue, but they have been this way forever and the quality of the shoe far outweighs the long tongue. I know you can purchase the ""original"" with a smaller tongue, but I have read that they are prone to squeaking. I plan on buying more."
adidas I see why everyone loves these. I love these sambas! Feels great when you kick a soccer ball with them and I wear them casually which is a 2 for 1 deal right there. I got the white ones and WILL be ordering the black ones soon.
"adidas Wore these for awhile l, just now tearing apart, perfect fit"
"adidas I ordered these as a women's shoe. I normally wear a 9 - 9.5, I should have gotten a half size up I think but they are wearable as is. I think they will break in nicely."
adidas Bought these for my husband. He likes them and said they fit perfectly!
"adidas For the price you can never go wrong with the sambas.  Super sturdy construction - these shoes will never fall apart and of course the classic style looks great.  BE AWARE THEY RUN SMALL.  I usually wear an 11, but always order a 12 in sambas."
"adidas the quality is good, size 11.5 was right, but a bit tight --- I've got about 10 hours in them with half walking around the house and half playing futsol -- breaking in okay, but rather tight on front of foot so I hope they breakin and soften up to fit my foot"
"adidas These shoes were a Christmas gift, but my dad and I have been buying these shoes for years! At one point I had 2 pairs - one for soccer and one just to wear casually that did not get beat up so often. The sole can be a bit bothersome at first if you don't have a high arch but you get used to it quickly and forms to your foot in a short while."
adidas Not sure if it was me or not but my old sambas were 10.5 so obviously I ordered the same size and the new ones are too big.
"adidas Had to remove the arch support because it was absolutely useless and uncomfortable. After removal, shoe is still uncomfortable. Must be broken in by running in them for at least 10 hours over a period of time. After that point where they finally become comfortable you have limited time to get use from them as they begin to fall apart."
adidas Bought them for my 14 year old son. He thinks they're great. The fit is good and no quality of construction issues. He got the shoe model with the longer tongue. I'm not sure why as the tongue goes up the ankle farther than I like but he is happy with the shoes.
"adidas I wore these shoes twice, then the inner circle in the sole popped out. Normally these are wondrous shoes, but this pair was defective. Buyer beware!!"
"adidas Love these shoes. Always have. I will say that I wear them until they have holes in the rubber bottoms (about five years). The arch support wears out well before then, which is a bummer, but they're still my favorite."
adidas Love them!
"adidas Adidas are some of the best shoes on the market, quality sure beats Nike. These shoes were originally designed for soccer so they last forever; you can wear them casually, for golf, or whatever"
"adidas I love these shoes and I always have. A classic never dies. I'm a size 8 in women's shoes and I ordered a size 7 in men's. They fit perfectly. I've heard of people complaining about having squeaky problems with Sambas but this can be easily remedied with some chapstick or balm between the tongue and lace area, but no complaints from me, I'm happy."
"adidas I'm on my second day, so I haven't really broken them in yet--please keep that in mind. These shoes are REALLY stiff out of the box. They seem a little tight, but I think they'll break in. This has made for a very uncomfortable first few days!!! I'm not too worried about it (yet).<br/><br/>Now, break-in period discomfort aside, these shoes seem very well built compared to my previous¬†<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Levis-Men-s-Jordy-Buck-Fashion-Sneaker-Black-Brown-13-M-US/dp/B00IV61798"">Levis Men's Jordy Buck Fashion Sneaker,Black/Brown,13 M US</a>¬†which only lasted 2 months before falling apart. For &lt; $50, they're great! The tongue is massive and awkward, like it is the same tongue design Adidas had for a high-top, but they put into a low-top. Is this some type of strange ankle protection design for people who play much more soccer than I do? I don't know? There's even a thread on Reddit discussing trimming the tongue down to look like a classic, which might have to happen.<br/><br/>I give them 4/5 because so far I'm not ""blown away"" by these shoes, but I expect a very high quality product that will last a very long time. I just hope the break-in period isn't terribly long, or I might have to revert to another pair of shoes every other day."
"adidas These are my go-to shoes for literally any occasion except formalwear.  They go with *anything* and are super comfortable.  They fit great, are priced appropriately, and go just as well with jeans as they do with chinos."
adidas my husban love them
"adidas This is my second pair of of adidas sambas, my first pair lasted me 10 years before they didn't have any sole left. My new pair looks to be just as well built as my previous pair"
adidas All time best shoes from Adidas. Been wearing them since I was a child. Pair # 16 currently
"adidas I bought these for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day. I ordered them larger because the reviews said to. I ended up ordering 1 half men's size larger (8.5), and they fit perfectly. If I would have ordered a full size larger, they would have been too big.<br/><br/>Women tend to have narrower feet than men, so if you order for a women, get 1/2 size larger. Men, 1 full size.<br/><br/>SHE LOVED THEM OMG :)"
adidas I have been wearing Sambas for eight years. They are the definitive walking shoe. Don't use for any sport other than indoor soccer. They don't offer adequate support for your knees and ankles. Suggest supplementing them with an ankle brace.
"adidas Been wearing Samba's for more years than I care to remember. Now difficult to get hold of and I was wary of purchasing shoes online. However, the fit was perfect."
adidas Absolutely perfect.  Shoes look 100% brand new but I got them on a warehouse deal for crazy cheap.  Been wearing these off and on for about 15 years.  Thanks so much!!
adidas Great traction been using them as indoor paintball and airsoft shoes and never slip or slide and they grip like no ones business.
adidas My pair from Amazon felt a bit narrow comparing to identical size at the footwear stores.  However that is not too bad and I imagine the shoes will stretch out a little over time.
"adidas Overall, these fit a bit larger than I expected, but they are the original Sambas that I love! One thing, the upper leather seems more synthetic than the leather on my last pair of sambas. I think it's probably because they haven't been broken in yet, but it's a bit strange. They feel just a little bit cheaper, hence the 4 star rating."
"adidas The title really says it all. I've had a lot of different tennis shoes but these are bar none the best I've ever had. The arch support is amazing. I could walk miles in these shoes and my feet wouldn't even feel it. Seriously, this is a no brainer if you're on the fence. They look great, and are even more comfortable. I get compliments all the time on them, and my feet feel great even after a long day of walking. Thumbs up! Get some suede protectant for the front of the toe though, you'll be thankful!"
"adidas I ordered 11.5, and it is labeled so.... but it feels like an 11. Strange since all my other shoes and sneakers are 11.5 and my feet fit perfectly.<br/>Don't know. Still on the fence to return them."
adidas My husband loved his surprise adidas they fot perfectly. What i liked about these ones they dodnt have the white bottom sole because my husband ditys his shoes soooo fast hard to keep them clean but not these
"adidas Everything I love from the past. Comfortable fit and appear durable. Be warned, there is not much of a foot arch and the tongue doesn't seem to stay where you want it to. Then again, this is exactly what I expected from these shoes."
adidas Thanks to my guys in Vulfpeck - I added these Insoles for the arch support that's needed<br/><br/>https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZ6YXGW/ref=oh_aui_bia_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
adidas Love of my life lives in these shoes. Since junior high he has worn these. Great then. Great now. Both of them. Haha. Speedy delivery and exactly what I ordered.
adidas I was forced to buy these for my 12 year old son who has huge feet after he saw his 6 year old brother with his new pair.<br/><br/>he now thinks that I am a super dad and the boys both have the same styled shoe :-)<br/><br/>will wait to see how they stand up to the abuse by his big feet and will give a follow up report..
adidas This is my third pair of Sambas. They are very comfortable and are low-key in appearance. My only complaint is that the tongue of the shoe is way to high- I had to cut it off to make it comfortable around my ankles. I assume the long tongue has something to do with protection of the ankle during soccer.
"adidas Awesome arch support. Have been using sambas for more than a decade now. I've tried many other indoor soccer shoes, but these take the trophy by miles. Good quality leather, and stylish look allows for them to be worn casually all day."
adidas Cool looking sneaker!
adidas Searched everywhere for these for Christmas for my boyfriend. He has a pair but they are over 5 years old. Got these at a great price and he loves them!
"adidas Decent shoes for the cost, received many compliments within the first week wearing them. Seems as thought they may break down over time, but only time will tell."
adidas Well made
"adidas I always wear size 12 M, but this one seems to be  tight from the width , I should replace it with 12.5 M , but I want to know is it will increase the length only or the width too?"
adidas Great quality and goes well with anything!
"adidas All was as expected, would order from this seller again.  Fit was perfect and arrived on time. Thank you!!!!!!!!  5 stars"
"adidas Great shoes, they run slightly big, but not so much that it makes them unwearable or uncomfortable, and the only other thing I would consider doing is replacing the insoles as the arch area is a little weird and seems to only come up on one side."
adidas Been wearing Sambas for years and love them. I wear custom orthotics so the flat bottom nature of these shoes is not an issue for me. I do wish they lasted a bit longer but $50 for a year of shoes is pretty good. Glad that Amazon has size 14 as none of my local shoe stores seem to ever have 14s in stock.
"adidas Quality shoe. Used it for 3 years and still use it as of today. The problem with the shoe is its arch support. I wear this shoe almost everyday, and I have pain under neath my leg. I have to see a doctor for this."
"adidas I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them. They shipped very quickly and looked great. He wears a men's 12, so that's what we ordered, and he said they fit perfectly."
adidas 20 years in the same shoe. Can't go wrong. I buy a new pair every 2 years or so. Excellent cost to wear ratio. I keep my old pair for yard work and the new pair for every day use.
"adidas Not as much wiggle room as I was hoping for, but a beautiful, classic shoe nonetheless. Dress up or down."
adidas Love these shoes
"adidas I bought my son these shoes after spending a lot of money on various versions of Michael Jordan's shoes, which did nothing to support his feet and ankles. I bought these shoes and he still wears them. They really are great shoes for the money."
adidas These were a gift for our grandson.  He loves them.  They fit perfectly and he was wearing them today when we saw him.  This is his 2nd pair....the last pair are 4 years old and he still wears them.  Very good product.
"adidas I've owned about 6 or 7 pairs of these shoes, I'll wear one pair until they get too worn out which generally takes a year and a half or so, slower now that I wear dress shoes for a different job every day. Very comfortable, look nice with just about anything. Only thing I don't like out of the box is the laces are a little longer than needed, so I usually cut them or tie them off to a tightness that I like."
"adidas A really good and nice looking shoe, perfect for indoor soccer."
adidas These shoes fit well and are very comfortable. I have wide feet and they are not narrow like some of the other adidas soccer shoes. These shoes have a high arch in the sole. You  can take the arch out if it is too much or bothers you.
"adidas Great indoor soccer shoe; my son wears them to school also.  This is his second pair of Sambas - he loves them.  Not a ton of arch support, but that's easily solved by ordering up a half-size or whole-size and using orthotics."
"adidas We love this shoe, it is of good quality and very nice looking"
adidas The sizes are way off.  I am normally a 12 in every shoe I've bought.  However in these I am a size 14.  I had to return the size 12 and it cost me 10$.
"adidas Love Sambas!  Once you wear them in and the shoe gets a little more stretched out, they fit like a glove.  If you wear these daily, the soles will wear out first.  I usually get a year or two of medium-to-heavy use out of them before I need to replace."
"adidas These shoes are not made real leather, as is advertised in the description. Appears to be plastic of some sort. Disappointing. I sent them back."
"adidas Excellent set of shoes. Very comfortable. Requires a slight amount of wear time in order to form to your foot, which is true of all shoes. The foot forming is just exceptionally important to the Samba it seems."
"adidas Timeless, simple, excellent. I use these for weight training, krav maga, or just casual. Excellent shoes, and they last forever. As the leather breaks in, they only become better."
adidas The tongue is a lot longer than expected of you've never owned a pair. I almost want to fold it over. I am a women's 8.5 and I ordered a mens 6.5. The toe area is tight..my feet aren't very wide. Maybe I would suggest ordering up if you are in the half sizes. Hopefully they will break in.
"adidas Love these shoes, they look just as shown and feel great. I wear them all day everyday standing while working. I get compliments on them all the time."
adidas My son feels like Beckham in these beauties
"adidas Great shoes! The arch support took a short amount of time to get used too, but it's not uncomfortable to me. (You can take it out if it's uncomfortable)"
"adidas had to return the two sets of shoes I purchased that where a size 11, guess my husband's foot grew.  The return was very simple and then I reordered them and got the replacements just as fast as the original."
"adidas Bought these for weight-lifting primarily. Comfortable enough to wear around all day. A bit narrow, but that's good for this kind of shoe -- it feels like an extension of your body."
"adidas I've been wearing Sambas for ten years or so.  Apparently they've started making them narrower.  I compared the soles (a part that doesn't stretch) of the new pair to my old worn out ones and there's a notable difference.  Still comfortable, just a bit more snug than I'm used to."
"adidas I love the shoes and had them before when I was younger, but they are not meant to be worn in cold weather!  I don't know if there is a leak, but it seems like if there's a little water on the ground, my feet will get wet.  Again though, these are meant for indoor soccer, not everyday wear."
adidas Love the high arch in these shoes and the quality. My previous pair lasted almost three years of daily use. The only thing is the large tongue- designed for football- it actually gave me a blister on my leg so I had to fold it forward when wearing with shorts.
"adidas I love Sambas, and I've worn them exclusively for years now. They're the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, especially after they're broken in after a few months. I also love the look, it's simple but iconic with the traditional three stripes of Adidas."
"adidas Nice shoes - cool style. if the arch support is too much, you can easily remove the extra material. Comfortable and fits true to size."
"adidas I can do anything in them, from running around on a soccer field to teaching school to doing yard work.  I have worn Samba's for many years, and my mantra is that if you can't do it in Sambas, maybe you shouldn't be doing it."
"adidas I bought these shoes for weightlifting and truly enjoy them. That being said, I can not wear them longer than an hour without my feet killing me. They are a great shoe, but I would not say they are the most comfortable."
"adidas I wasn't sure what to expect with these shoes since I've never owned them previously, but they are actually very comfortable and fit true to size. They may feel a little narrow for people who have wider feet. The high tongue on these shoes may take some getting used to for some people--they did for me--but once the shoes break in a bit they are very comfortable. I prefer the white color to the black, I think they look more sporty."
"adidas Bought these for my 13 year old daughter.  Since it's a men's size, it was tricky picking a size.  We went with a size 8, which fits perfectly with some room to wiggle the toes.  She has a wide foot."
"adidas Always love my Sambas, but the fabric inside the hell wore away within a month, which must be a record."
adidas These shoes are great but the arch support is made for people with very high arches. after a day or two they start to wear down to fit your arch but still have a mild discomfort in the arch.
adidas I wear an 8 1/2 and had to exchange them for an 8 as they were to long. If you are wearing them for playing with thicker socks and shinguards then I would stay a little bit larger. Other then that they are great!
"adidas Ok shoes, I just really miss the kangaroo leather and the other tongue. This tongue slides up my ankle, but I love the classic look"
"adidas I've ALWAYS wore sambas and every other adidas shoe in size 10.5 why these fit like size 10, I'll never know..."
"adidas What can I say, I love Sambas and have been wearing them for years. These are still made with the quality of the ones I was wearing in the gym in the early 90's."
"adidas My son wears this shoe for his indoor soccer practice. I use to wear the same shoe when I was his age. Overall an excellent indoor shoe!! If you are looking for a quality shoe at a very reasonable price, this is a great buy."
"adidas love the shoe, I wear a 12.5 and I could have gone with a 12 maybe. IT fits well, and would buy them again.<br/>seller was great."
"adidas Great soccer shoes, held up when I was playing on cement and hard rough surfaces. Looks like a regular shoe also so I used it to go out and not always for soccer."
"adidas I l've these shoes, I purchased them a few years back and I still wear them frequently. The are durable and are still comfortable. A classic style with comfort you can't beat that."
"adidas This is my go for sneakers for daily activities. It is traditional, simple, comfortable and not bad looking at all. The leather quality is not perfect, but it is not bad. Craftsmanship was a bit subpar but then again that's what you get for paying this much. It does not squeak as many reviewers mentioned."
"adidas Had these shoes as a kid, and they have changed them. The tongue of the shoe is very long, and comes up the front of your ankle a bit, and also the shoes make an odd noise when walking on a hard surface. Fit is as expected, I am normally a 10.5 to an 11. I ordered an 11 and they are big on me, so I would recommend 1/2 size down. Other than that, comfortable, cool looking shoe."
"adidas Daughter needed these for indoor soccer. She hasn't been able to use them in a game yet, but she loves the way they look and fit!"
adidas Cheaper than Dick's!!
adidas Best arch support I've ever found in a shoe. Classic style only though if you want the good arch support. I wear them everywhere and will continue wearing them as long as they keep the good arch support in future releases.
adidas Love them
"adidas the samba shoe is a great athletic shoe. Now it is the only type shoe I prefer overall, it has been very comfortable so much so that I had worn them out and need replacement.<br/>However, I have a samba size 10 that I enjoyed so I made this order but these are tighter than the pair I have I need to change for a half size or one full size more."
adidas I bought these as a gift for my 14-year old son who absolutely loves them.  He plays soccer but wears these daily not necessarily to play so I this rating is style-based.
adidas These are for my growing boy.  He loves them but they were a bit big.  We could have ordered them a size too big.
adidas VERY NICE PRODUCT
adidas I got these after being shunned and ridiculed for wearing toe shoes. I had no idea what an a$$hole I looked like wearing those things.<br/><br/>Now I have Addidas Sambas and I can show my face in public.
"adidas Huge fan of these shoes (even if they have a huge tongue), and the Arch support is amazing. I actually had to order 1/2 a size larger than I normally do though (generally a 9.5, had to get a 10). All the same, between Amazon's great return policy, and my new shoes, I'm a happy camper."
adidas Material feels cheap on the exterior and the arch support is sharp and poor quality (literally a small piece of foam glued under the padding) had to replace the interior of the shoe to even make it wearable. I will not buy again.
"adidas Best shoes ever. Consistently (through the years) comfortable, perfect size, and high quality. If you think you like them now, wait until they get worn in and that leather gets all soft and buttery!"
adidas Fit smaller than other addidas shoes.  I have a narrow foot but these are too tight in the toe box.  Plan to exchange for half size larger than normal.
adidas A+
adidas samba loyalist.  great price!
adidas Great
"adidas Only wore these shoes 3 times.  I bought them to play Table Tennis in.  All natural rubber sole was the selling point for me.  Addidas is a premium product and there was no reason, so far, to dispute that. They fit well, solid material's (bottom to top). Some times shoe companies send free products to try out you know. Sooooo.. keep my address, aha?  Point Pilot"
adidas GREAT upgrade for indoor soccer shoes... Very stylish &amp; I get many compliments on the court.
"adidas Great shoe, been wearing Sambas for years.  Built to take a beating on the field, lasts a LONG time as an everyday gym shoe."
"adidas Best shoes ever. Squeek goes away after a couple of days. These shows should be what we give to the aliens when we make contact. Dont show them a silly gold disk, the computer, reality tv, etc. Show them these bangin sambas"
"adidas I purchased two pairs.  One pair was fine, on the other pair the left insole wasn't fitted corrected so my foot felt twisted when I had the sneaker on.  That pair got returned and on the replacement pair the right insole doesn't feel like it is fitted correctly.  I can feel the arch part of the insole against my foot whereas I do not have this feeling with the first good pair or even on the other shoe of the replacement pair.  Very disappointed."
adidas They fit as expected...they classics....
adidas I wore them for one day and my feet were killing me. They were way to small I wear a nine but I needed a ten
"adidas These things are nearly indestructible. Nevertheless, I must be on my 6th or 7th pair. Use 'em for sitting, walking, hiking, running, biking, soccer, basketball, thinking, loafing, etc."
"adidas I dont have a wide foot, but these tend to run on the skinnier side for me.  They also have the highest arch support i have ever had in a shoe.  Even though my shoe did not fit an I'm returning it now, I still like sambas and have worn out a few pair over the years till they fall apart."
"adidas I got a 10.5 and they're the perfect length but they run a bit narrow. The arch support was too much for me, so I reached under the sole and ripped out the foam.<br/><br/>On the plus side, after about a month of regular wear with no maintenance, these shoes look brand new. Gum sole is the best."
"adidas Adidas Samba, the best indoor soccer shoe ever made. Simply the best!"
adidas So comfy. Just as I remember from wearing them in high school.
adidas Classic
adidas It's been awhile since I owned a pair and I am so happy that I made the purchase. They need a little breaking in but feel great now after about a week or so. They don't squeak like some other buyers mentioned. Not sure what that is all about.
adidas Normally wear size 8 women's; a 7 fit well. A little narrow in the toe box until they're broken in.
"adidas Large tongue and somewhat small, hurts the top of my foot while I run and walk. Good for price but wish the size was the actual size I chose. I chose a 9.5 but I received a 9.0"
"adidas My 3rd pair of these shoes. I order them a bit on the small side, and breaking them in is painful, but once they are, they are a dream. LOVE these shoes, and will continue to wear them."
adidas These are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn.  I usually take a women's 7.5 US and the Men's 6.5 fit perfectly.
"adidas I love the look and feel of these shoes, but the toe box was much too large for me even though the ""fit right"" sizer recommended the size I ordered."
"adidas Sambas never change and that is what I love about them. The longer you wear this shoe the more comfortable it becomes. The worst day is when the shoe finally wears out because even though a new pair looks great, a worn in pair feels amazing."
"adidas my favorite shoes of all time. Great for walking and the gym. My favorite use for these shoes is for doing barbell squats, they are perfect because they are fairly flat."
"adidas I bought these big because I've noticed that Adidas runs up to 2 sizes small in regards to width. Normally a 12-4E, got these 14...a little long but for $20, can't beat it."
adidas Love em!!!
"adidas Everyone knows this shoe by now. They don't fit as comfortable as I remember my first pair when I was a kid, but they're great for a casual shoe and are awesome for indoor sports."
adidas This will be my 6th or 7th pair of classic sambas. $50 every couple years for an amazing pair of shoes is a no brainer.
adidas This is my first pair of these since I was maybe 12. I really like these and plan to buy more when I wear these out.
adidas These are my son's favorite shoes and he has worn them for years.  The fit as expected and seem to stand up to a lot of use.
"adidas Ive had a pair of these since i was 11 and im in my mid 30's. Never disappointed.  They are always made the same, perfect."
"adidas Samba's feel like home to my son.  Even at age 15, with a 12.5 size foot!"
adidas These are a classic. Bought them for my son. I had a pair of them  them as a teenager and I was very surprised whem my son asked me for some Adidas Samba sneakers. He loves them.
adidas It is good shoe but it feels a little small.  I guess I need a wide shoe.  I wear size 11 but for this shoe I knew to order 11 and 1/2. The shoe was still small. I like to wear two shocks but now I need to wear only one.  Other than that the shoe is great and gives you good support.
"adidas Fit as expected, arches were too high and stiff but they are easily removed. Only had them for a week, but they are holding up well to my work in a mechanic shop."
"adidas Shoes are very narrow and the arch is very high inside the sole. Can be uncomfortable if you don't have high arches and/or narrow feet. My feet are pretty small and I'm not flat, so... beware I guess."
adidas I get a pair of these every year.  They're super comfortable and last a long times.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs to put shoes on their feet!
"adidas Great shoe, already broken in after a few days of use. Super comfy would recommend. Runs about a 1/2 size smaller than expected."
adidas They run a half-size too big but great for indoor soccer.
"adidas I knew that these ran a little bit larger, so I bought slightly smaller.  In my opinion, they run about a .5 size larger."
"adidas Just read the rest of the reviews. They are all true. Perfect indoor soccer shoes, and I even use these shoes for warm-ups before a race (I'm on my college's track &amp; field team). They slip on like socks, feel too comfortable, are really warm (too warm sometimes actually!), and look great IMO. Definitely going to get another pair in white!"
adidas Perfect everyday wear shoe
"adidas Great for the indoor play and great for everyday wear. But if you wear them too much, they get a bit smelly. But that's to be expected from all types of shoes...."
adidas I have been wearing Somba's for almost 40 years and these were as expected.  Delivery was on time.
"adidas I have been wearing the Samba for many, many years.  After a few hours of wearing them they begin to take the shape of your foot.  They provide a tactile experience for your foot like no other sneaker (soles and uppers).  Run, walk or relax in total comfort.  Great all-around sneaker."
"adidas Perfect for drumming. Been using these for more than a decade now. On my 3rd pair. And of course superb for their intended purpose as well: indoor futsal shoe.<br/><br/>Probably not the best for everyday walking though, but only emos would do that anyway. And you're not an emo, are you?"
adidas Great shoes. Had to send back the first pair for a size larger. But they fit great.
adidas The shoes are grea qualityt! The description says exact fit however mine seem to run a bit large.
adidas Great shoes. I have owned these shoes before and really like them. They are very comfortable as everyday shoes with a nice arch.
"adidas My now teenager love these Sambas, it's his 2nd pair in 4yrs. They are strong and can take a real good beating, sun or rain. He used his 1st pair for indoor soccer. They are also some nice casual sneakers to rock with some blue jeans."
adidas Excellent for soccer indoor.
"adidas I used to wear these as a kid, but then I bought them again and they didnt fit as I remembered. Ended up returning them and getting something else!"
adidas Classic Sambas. Great dimensions and comfort. Along with their wonderful sporty soccer look and feel. Cheaper than the price asked by local stores (sports stores and Adidas stores).
"adidas Perfect, just as they have been for the better part of two decades."
adidas Great looking shoe. I bought these to use as deadlifting and squatting shoes however they were extremely narrow for my feet. I couldnt use them and ended up returning them.
"adidas I use them as everyday walking shoes. The tongues were bothering me, so I cut them off. You honestly can't tell that it has been cut down if you round off the corners a little bit."
"adidas Super sturdy, classic look, very comfortable. I have been. Buying these for my son for years and he loves them. Buy a 1/2 size bigger"
"adidas My kid has wide feet, and has had trouble with soccer shoes his whole life, so I am always on the lookout for shoes that lean wide. These fit him well - I got him a half size bigger than his usual. He says they feel great, and work very well for indoor soccer. No slipping."
"adidas The arch support on them is too high for me, and hurt feet.  If it weren't for that, I'd probably like them."
adidas The Adidas Samba classic soccer shoe fits great and wears great. The item was a gift for my son and he really loves this shoe. The item shipped quickly and arrived on time. I would recommend this product to anyone that is contemplating the purchase of an indoor soccer shoe.
"adidas This is my first pair of Sambas. I can't believe how much higher the quality is than most $50 sneakers. Living in NYC, I walk a ton. I go through cheapo brand sneakers like Aldo in about 3 months. This are 6 months old and look new. They will likely last _years_."
"adidas Don't get between me and my Sambas! These are far and beyond my favorite shoes. I have been a dedicated Sambas wearer since 2001, when I graduated from skater shoes. Initially, all Sambas will feel tight on the feet, but when the leather settles, they feel like slippers. I hope adidas never changes this design!"
"adidas I have had Samba's for years, even with the recent minor style changes they are still great. Amazon is the only place I can ever find size 13's."
adidas Unfortunately I Returned them. Size was off and not comfortable
"adidas While sizing was good, this shoe offered nothing in the way of arch support. Additionally the tongue is very long and digs in to the front of your leg"
adidas They fit spot on perfect to my average shoe size so far no complains about them very comfortable and affordable as a running shoe definitely will buy again
"adidas My daughter is a comp soccer player and she wears these all the time. I know they are technically men's shoes, but she does not care and neither do I. Since these are the only shoes I wear, we are always matching. Samba Classics are the coolest soccer shoes ever."
"adidas I have a prosthetic leg and  these soccer shoes are a perfect fit.  I have found that the Samba Classic<br/>makes it easier for me to walk on all surfaces.  I will need another pair in the near future, if they are<br/>still available in the old style."
adidas Same exact shoe carried by larger retail stores at a lower cost. Adidas Samba usually run $50 + tax in stores.
adidas Would wear them all day if they fitted me good but they run a bit small im an 11 needed an 11.5. Hurts my big toe nail.
adidas Not for running. Not for gym. Just for indoor futbol (soccer) (potato tomato). They work just as well on synthetic grass as on concrete and they look badass. I also wear them to walk when I go to walmart lol.
adidas These were purchased for my nephew. They are a good fit and he loves the style. They are very comfortable.
adidas Good shoes. Better than REGULAR Adidos. My indoor soccer game is currently BALLIN YO!!!!!
adidas Classic!
adidas Thought I couldn't find Sambas and then bam! Haven't worn them long enough to confirm that they're as good as the old ones but they seem good so far.
"adidas ¬°¬°Thank  you!! 10 stars, They look  better  when you  have  it"
"adidas On my feet all day, so I bought these work. Much more comfortable. Not bad on the price either"
adidas My favorite shoe. Always enjoy good quality that lasts. I still have them and still wear them and abuse them.
"adidas I have owned many pairs of these shoes over the years, and I absolutely lvoe them  They're fantastic.  But imagine my surprise when I went to check them out this time around, and the price had gone up!<br/><br/>I bought these shoes on Amazon in 2010 for $46!  Now they're $60 plus shipping! They're great shoes, but I think they're a little over-priced here... and can maybe be found a little cheaper elsewhere."
adidas My sons love these...have worn them every since they were teenagers.  Grown men now and still love them as casual shoes.
"adidas I typically wear a size 8 or 8.5 and these are tight in a size 9. I'm getting these in 10 next.<br/><br/>Regardless, I've had these for a year and a half and I LOVE them. Wear them almost every day and they hold up well. I don't see any wear besides my foot stretching the inside a bit."
adidas The shoe is very comfortable but I had to sole gave out in the middle of the shoe tread
"adidas My son just has too wide of a foot, he is only 11 years old, and we bought a 7.0 and a 7.5, neither fit him comfortably."
"adidas Nice shoe, but get a half size bigger. I have narrow flat feet and at the top of my foot the shoe is tight."
"adidas I've been wearing Samba's for 25 years and they are always perfect.  The arch support is good for me because I can't wear sneakers with a high arch, ie running shoes.  These Samba's are just as comfortable as every other pair I've had."
adidas Bought these for my 11 year old for the indoor soccer season. They seem well made and he loves them!
"adidas Excellent fit, very comfortable shoes. Bought them for my boyfriend and might buy a pair for myself!"
"adidas Comfortable, little narrower shoe. Stylish old school feel, love the rugged look. Wear with pretty much anything. Fits as expected. Highly recommend this fantastic shoe."
adidas Returned; too small. Waiting for replacement
"adidas Very comfortable shoes, looked exactly like the photo. The long tongue rubs against your ankle if you don't use long socks, but other than that no complaints"
adidas These shoes had a huge tongue and the colors didn't really match. I'll go to adidas store next time.
"adidas I ordered the shoes and they came in like 2 days early, which was nice but i neglected to notice how big the tongue is in the picture, these shoes are ideally for skinnier jeans or shorts, where the tongue can be displayed, this wasn't exactly what i wanted but they have great arch support which is cool and fit pretty well..."
"adidas These shoes are great! Perfect fit and well built, very stylish design. You Cannot beat it for the price. Very happy with my purchase."
"adidas I have been buying this brand of shoes for over 20 years now. They fit like they always do, they feel great on my flat feet!!"
adidas Fit as expected - just wish Adidas made wider sizes and would go back to the three stripes instead of their current lines that look like someone walked through a poorly maintained paint factory.
adidas perfect
"adidas Shoe was narrow. If you have wide feet, it'll hurt them like it hurt mine. The size was fine but it was very narrow"
adidas I have worn sambas since they came out and this last pair seemed different. The arch on my left shoe was too big whilest the right was too small that is my only problem these shoes are great espcially for the price
"adidas I wear a 10 ¬Ω usually but I need an 11 with these shoes because even with my skinny feet, they are too tight."
"adidas These are a classic, any way to cut it.  Super comfortable with a clean look.  The gum soles are great for not showing dirt and wear, but the uppers are easy to clean."
adidas Great pair of classic shoes. Comfortable and stylish!
adidas These sneakers are the perfect addition to my summer wardrobe. I can wear them with my chinos for a casual dressy look or down play with jeans and a T.
adidas Product is cool and but it's tight .that why I need a replacement of another size..<br/>Tjanks
adidas Literally the only type of shoe i have worn for the past 10 years. 5/5 will buy again in approx 8 months when I wear these out.
"adidas They run a little narrow, got them for my boyfriend but returned as they don't come in a wide."
"adidas A little different then the ones I bought years ago , but still love the classic sporty look."
adidas Shoe has a flap longer than expected where the brand is display. It is somehow uncomfortable.
adidas My all time favorite shoes. I will buy them as long as they keep making/selling them. Classic
"adidas mt son likes the shoes ,but the are a  bit small, however the  next half size is a bit large."
adidas I bought a pair back in 2008 and still wear them to this day but they are a little beat up and old but they still fit great and look good but decided to go ahead and buy a new pair anyways.  Just as expected the new pair is simply awesome.  Sambas are the best shoes I have ever owned.
adidas Perfect Samba shoes exactly as my son has worn for years. Authentic Adidas. Shipped quickly.
adidas The shoes look great except one of them has a big scuff mark on the suede part of the front toe area. Since they are for my son and will be destroyed rapidly I will keep them. Just wasn't what I expected for full price.
adidas Love these. I have the Original also. I like both. Classic is good for soccer/running and Original is good for casual wearing.
adidas Excellent
adidas Good fit!
"adidas The sole on this thing is so uncomfortable. If you don't like the arch, take out the sole from the shoe and remove the white foam that is underneath it. It will never break in if you don't take this out. If you have this problem, I hope this helps!"
adidas These are good shoes. I have had them before and knew exactly what to expect. Comfortable and conform to average sizing.
"adidas Ordered here and the shoes seemed fake, then returned and ordered through Adidas, completely different shoes. Be careful!!"
adidas They wear like iron and look sharp. Just as good as I remember them from when I was a kid.
adidas I love Sambas and these fit great. Definitely not knock-offs. Still fit great months later
"adidas I live in a college town and get everywhere by biking and walking, so I'm pretty hard on shoes. Sambas can take a serious beating and stay good looking."
adidas This is my third or fourth pair and I've worn them both indoor soccer and dancing for years.  They probably would have lasted much longer if I hadn't of washed them :-(
adidas Great for indoor football ( Soccer) shoe. I wear my shoes to punk rock shows. Super comfortable...
"adidas My favorite type of shoes, sucks more and more people are wearing them now. Flat bottoms are good for lifting weights but some people take out the insouls and replace them wuth others. I have flat feet and they seem just fine for me but I am not finicky."
"adidas Shipped quickly, in perfect condition and fit just how I needed. These classics are dope!"
adidas Love them.
adidas Excellent indoor soccer sneaker. If you have used sambas before but haven't tried the classic ones they are good for playing indoor soccer and for walking around.
"adidas My husband loves these shoes, he has been wearing them off and on since middle school, so somewhere around 15 years.  We usually replace them every year and a half of constant wear and retire the old set to yard shoes."
"adidas Love these but they are a little flat footed on the bottom, but maybe that's because they are men's shoes. I just couldn't find any good women's soccer shoes. I just put a couple of foot pads in and they work good. Great toe support!"
"adidas These shoes are my favorite sneakers. I wear them primarily for casual wear. I'm a female, so I would recommend getting one size down (instead of the usual 2 sizes of most brands) than you are in women's shoes. They have a nice arch support. But not too high. I can tell they are very well made and look exactly like they do in this photo. Highly recommended!"
adidas I missed owning my own Sambas from when I was younger - now it's back on trend and super comfortable. Especially since I walk to and from work everyday.
"adidas A very nice shoe at this price, sharp and feel well made. Length is pretty good, but it is a narrow shoe. May stretch over time, just don't know yet."
"adidas Great shoes! Fit as I would expect, a little tight on the toes at first."
"adidas Bought for my boyfriend, he wears them almost everyday. I am mad I didnt buy some for myself,"
adidas Good
adidas If you're buying sambas you've had sambas. Nothing has changed. Can't do better than a high quality 40$ leather shoe
"adidas I've never had such a comfortable shoe for my cycling toe cages. I seem to set records in it, but that could be a placebo."
"adidas I have been a long time fan of the Adidas Samba shoes. Versatile, stylish, comfortable. They're my go to shoes for day to day activities. Amazon wins primarily for having the shoes I like in my size without any extra hassle."
"adidas I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. I was going to buy them in the store, but then I saw them here and decided to take a chance. They fit and he loves them."
adidas Same day service is pretty epic! And the size fit dead on! I wear them casually or with my scrubs for work. Good arch support as well
"adidas My son is hard on his shoes, I have to buy a new pair almost every month but these have lasted a long time. Great craftsmanship"
adidas These are the only shoes my son has worn on a regular basis for the last 3 years. Just started High School with a fresh new pair! Great quality that really stands up! Love them - great price too!
"adidas If you have a wide foot, forget it.I normally wear 11-1/2, if I go up to 12 shoes fit, not even a 13 was big enough in these"
adidas Timeless stile and as durable as can be.  I just replaced a pair that i had for more than 10 years.
"adidas Sambas are great shoes that will last and last if you care for them.  Both of my older sons wear them and love them.  They fit their exact shoe sizes. One has a flat foot and uses orthotics with them and still loves them.  Very stylish shoes, too."
"adidas Adidas Sambas are very great sneakers.  This is my 3rd pair of Sambas and I haven't yet found a fault with the shoes if used other than as intended.  They are light weight, comfortable, stylish, and one of the best values for a shoe &lt;$50.00.  I have used my Sambas to play indoor soccer or on gym floor.  Thanks to Amazon Prime, they arrived super quick and in great packaging.  I highly recommend these shoes for active wear seekers."
adidas On time and good as expected
adidas Good cost benefit soccer shoes that doubles as a everyday shoe. Not very comfortable though.
"adidas If you don't mind not having something flashy while playing soccer or just walking around, this shoe is great and takes a long time for it to wear out. This is my second pair in almost 18 monthsish.. for someone who uses them for everyday activities and indoor all the time its a great investment. Comfort ability, takes about a week or so for it to fit to your foot after that you can't feel a thing."
adidas All products purchased were great and shipping was fast
adidas These shoes are somewhat narrow and fit my feet well. My only complaint is that the white stripes seen to reveal black streaks and that the inside of the shoe seems to deteriorate over time. For the price though they are still worth buying and the shoes look great.
"adidas For some reason it's not as what it use to be.  I've loved wearing these from the time I've played soccer, for some reason this pair is not the same as my last pair that I wore.  Not sure what would be different, unless age is a factor."
adidas I bougth these shoes for my son and he told me they fit a litle narrow. Nevertheless he is wearing them for almost 3 continous hours a day.
"adidas MY SON WEARS THESE FOR fUTSAL AND THEY ARE A GREAT FIT, STAY ON, AND VERY COMFORTABLE."
"adidas I love Sambas. These arrived, looked great, looked the same as my current ones. It's just that I wear a 13. So I ordered 13s. Too small. Ordered the 13.5, too small. And they didn't have a 14.<br/><br/>- But that's not an issue with Adidas having changed their sizing perameters, that's the issue with THESE Sambas. They, specifically, are too small. (I ordered a different type/style of Sambas, thinking that I now needed to get a 14. But those were one full size too large!)<br/><br/>So it's been a frustrating process, and now after three pairs, I still have no Sambas to show for it. :/"
"adidas The product is very good, I totally recommend it. It was just a little larger than I thought it would be, but other than that it's perfect."
"adidas These shoes were for my son,  he says they are comfortable! I had to order a sz up for him!"
adidas The shoe is that expected
"adidas Worn these shoes and other similar Adidas for 15 years now, its all I plan to ever wear.  I even wore the Black/white Campus on my wedding day.  I have never worn an uncomfortable pair of Adidas shoes."
"adidas I really enjoy these shoes‚Äîswitching over from wearing canvas shoes, what I find is that these are a bit warmer to wear (which is great for New England). They‚Äôre very easy to slip on and off."
"adidas Love it just as advertised, came early in the morning so these and coffee were a great treat"
adidas I've used these shoes for quite a while... They will fit as a glove but you have to break them in first.
adidas Got my first pair when I was a kid and needed indoor soccer shoes and I'm still buying them because they are some of the best shoes out there.
adidas Way too narrow and one shoe did not come with a sole insert. Will be returning.
adidas Great shoe
adidas I've owned Samba's my entire life and have always enjoyed the look and feel of the shoe. You can never go wrong with the classics.
adidas They were a bit snug but nothing that couldn't be overcome with use.  Still my favorite shoe.
adidas Fit runs a tad small and narrow. I'd recommend getting a half size bigger to compensate. Fells great on the arches
"adidas These shoes are great for casual wear, but can also be used for athletic purposes, whether it be the gym or playing soccer"
"adidas used to own a pair of these for a number of years until the sole split off of the upper. just bought these to replace them and ordered the same size i used to have. either my foot got bigger or they've changed the sizing. the soul seems very stiff and the toe-box feels narrow. my toe doesnt hit the end but they seem rather tight, even when loosely laced. hopefully they'll soften up with age and stretch to be as comfy as my last pair."
"adidas This is probably my 10th pair of sambas, they tend to last me two or three years. Always made well and comfortable."
adidas Fit tight
"adidas This is my 3rd pair of Adidas Sambas. I wear them for daily use, not for indoor soccer. The first pair lasted a year before the plastic inner support in the heel became too damaged. The second pair I wore for about 15 months before the insole wore through. They break in easy and are comfortable around the ankle and heel."
adidas I've always loved this shoes as general run around shoes and for playing a quick pickup game of football (soccer).
adidas Some complained about too much arch support but the insole is removable. Fit great! Been wearing Sambas my whole life and these are still a great shoe!
adidas Good price and product. It just runs a bit small.
"adidas Shoes are slightly narrow. if you have wide feet or have run into this problem before, I would pick another shoe"
adidas Great shoes. I consider them kinda minimalist. It's the closes I can get to going barefoot.
"adidas Classic shoe can't go wrong here, nice to play indoor soccer and also to wear casually."
adidas I bought these shoes for my husband as a replacement for another pair of Sambas which was ready for retirement. He loves the looks and the overall fit but said that the shoe is not as comfortable as it used to be....he has purchase Adidas Sambas many times over the years. The sole feels much thinner and the support is rather poor. We went out and purchased some insoles so hopefully that will resolve the problem as he really likes the shoes.
"adidas It's the best, awesome perfact. Thanks Amazon thanks Adiddas."
adidas Hard to find these shoes in stores. Still the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn. Can't beat it!
"adidas Like an old friend<br/>Wore these in high school, and not much has changed<br/>Not sure why the long tongue, only thing I did not like"
"adidas I wore this shoes for about 4 months and the black has pretty turned light grey. don't know how else to restore the color. ive lightly brushed and wet it, but its still grey. The fit is perfect and true to US size. The shoes are very comfortable."
"adidas These shoes were exactly as I remember them. The fit is a bit snug near the toes, but I would expect that with new sneeks."
adidas They seem to be the sambas I remember from when I was younger. They fit nice and are great to slip on when I wanna do something.
adidas I wear the same hole in these shoes every sixth months or so and then I buy some more as part of being an adult.
adidas Love these shoes!
"adidas Ordered these for my son and he loves them. The old school style is perfect, quality is excellent and shipping time was quick. I would order these again and again!"
adidas Great shoe and timely delivery
"adidas Purchased the same shoe but in black two years ago. However, despite ordering the same size, this pair runs somewhat large. Large enough where the the heel cup slides up and down with walking. But the shoe look good with a pair of jeans."
adidas These are about the exact same shoe as I had 15 years ago and 25 years ago... Love these Sambas.
"adidas Love me some Samba's.  Extremely comfortable. Wear through them pretty fast at Futsak, but happy to reload often."
"adidas These are nice and quite comfortable, however, they seem a little bit smaller than the regular sambas (not classic, with a shorter tongue)."
adidas Excellent soccer sneakers. After trying it my son ordered one for him.
adidas I got these for cycling.  Work good with metal pedals.  Better for walking than cycling shoes
adidas An all time classic - I love these shoes for playing indoor soccer or just walking around town...
"adidas Love the shoes as I've had the same pair as three years ago, but the size is too small.  Hoping they break in a bit."
"adidas Fit is great, same shoe I've been buying for years and years. Tongue does not squeak! Took a couple days to break in, stiffer tongue made the top of my feet sore but after two days they feel great like they should. Fit is perfect."
adidas It fits as expected and looks great. They are pretty comfortable too.
adidas Nothing better than adidas!
adidas Its very narrow so not very comfortable.
adidas Great shoes but they are too tight. My husband will need a wide fit.
"adidas Love Adidas, always seems to be hardest to size properly. I would suggest a half size larger than you anticipate."
"adidas Per my 12 year old. ""These are AMAZING!  They feel GREAT!""  Mom's opinion, good quality."
adidas These shoes have a very long tung on them. I just fold it over and tuck it in so it is not hanging out there.
adidas Much more narrow than expected. Not complaints with quality nor the store they were great!
adidas These were perfect got them on time am one very satisfied customer!
adidas I've bought these for my husband twice now. He loves them because they are so comfortable and can wear them daily. They are very durable and are true to size. I am sure I will be buying again in the future because they are his go to shoes.
"adidas Delivered on time. Ive owned these before, cant tell you how much I love them. Comfortable and they last a long time."
"adidas Since ordering, these are pretty much all I wear. They're comfortable and work well with jeans and khakis. I also really like the arch support these provide. All in all, a very comfortable shoe whose style has withstood the test of time."
"adidas These shoes will never not be cool. They are well made, and last forever. They fit true to size. Do yourself a favor and buy these."
"adidas I have worn these in rhe past when my foot was not fulling grown.  However, even the size 14 (largest size) is too small for me as an adult."
adidas Great shoes very comfortable great for walking and the best part was the awesome price.
"adidas First of all, the shoe came amazingly fast. In about 3 days, it was at my doorstep. When I tried it on, the cushioned sole was comfortable and everything was like it looks in the picture. BUT, the shoe did run a little narrow and a little bit short. Not enough to ruin the fit, but just enough for my toes to be against the front while walking. Therefore, I reccommend ordering .5 a size up."
"adidas Love these shoes!  I wear a size 11 in mens.  They fit great, no real break in time.  Very comfortable."
adidas Was a bit nervous about ordering shoes online. I used to wear these in high school when I played soccer. They haven't changed a bit. I wear these as my every day out-and-about shoes. Would definitely recommend them
adidas A little bit tight in the toes. Wish i would have gone a half size higher if possible. Has pronounced arch support which is comfortable if you're used to that. Overall 8/10 cuz they look ballin
"adidas I have worn these shoes for years. My house is littered with old pairs that I have kept because of their durability. However, in the past year I have found that the shoes are not being made like they used to. The sole is warped and the rubber falls apart, Additionally, the leather patch splits on top. Perhaps its just me but I have returned these shoes twice in the past and I recommend that you buy them from somewhere else. Perhaps an Adidas store would be a better choice. It might cost a few bucks more but I bet it won't fall apart."
"adidas These shoes are fantastic. They look great out of the box, and have really good quality. This is probably my third or fourth pair, only getting new ones because I grow out of them. It doesn't take too long for your feet to get comfortable in them, and I would definitely recommend them. One tip though, if the black fuzzy part ever gets dirty, a toothbrush does the job pretty well."
adidas Most comfortable sneaker there is!!!
adidas fit good arrived early
"adidas It's comfortable. It's a one on my favorite. It make with good material, good size. Anyway it's a wonderful shoes!!! OMG"
adidas Literally best shoes I've owned. Highly satisfied
"adidas Everything went well!  Fits nice, looks nice. Comfortable shoe."
adidas Comfy shoes with a small'ish toe box and a medium to high arch.
adidas This is not the same shoe that my husband expected.  He likes the other model.
adidas Not super comfortable. I'm not sure how people actually play indoor soccer in these. I have a hard enough time walking in them.
adidas Normally I have no problems with shoes but these seem to run a little larger than normal. Just enough to make the heel slip a little when walking. I will probably have to get a heel grip or something similar to remedy the problem. Everything else is great though.
adidas The Adidas Samba shoes have not changed a bit since I first started using them when I was 10 years old.  The Samba shoes are perfect for daily activities and are extremely durable.  You cannot go wrong with this brand and model.
"adidas Somewhat small, but a great shoe. Love the shoe!"
"adidas Ordered these shoes there was a mix up was not happy but village shoes was very very cooperative and got them here fast!!!<br/><br/>for me these are the only shoes for me i use them for regular shoes they last many years and are comfortable and i beat the heck out of them i do long distance running, outdoor/indoor soccer hiking camping rock climbing all the above."
adidas Most comfortable shoe I've purchased. Size is perfect for me especially since I have narrow feet.
"adidas I've worn the Samba for a week now, and played a couple indoor soccer games on them as well.  Shoe fits great, has nice support.  Has lateral support as well, which is useful when playing indoor soccer of course.  Look to be of good quality, worth ~$50."
adidas These have been my go to shoes for at least five years. They hold up well and have given me countless days of comfort.
adidas Fashionable
adidas Really nice shoe.  Fits my husband's feet nicely.  They look good on.  Good quality.  Very satisfied with my purchase.
adidas Sweet and gnarly dude lololololol
adidas My son loves these shoes. They always hold up extremely well.
adidas Worn since high school (90's) and always a comfortable fit.
"adidas My husband has four titanium rods in his back and these are the only shoes he can wear without being in extreme pain, hopefully Adidas will never stop manufacturing that style."
adidas Looks clean on foot
adidas This shoe might be a good shoe. I have a wide foot so it the rating reflects my personal fit. Don't buy if you have wide feet.
"adidas I put my favorite shoes onto my favorite feet and then I walk around. Comfortable, even on the first wear."
"adidas I couldn't be happier with these shoes they fit my feet like socks, also ordered 1/2 smaller saw some people complaining they were a tad too big, well great shoes really comfortable and good looking sometimes I don't know if I'm barefooted lol,"
adidas I give a two stars because they kinda Fit good
adidas Excellent! Brand new and in perfect condition!
adidas This was an incredible deal! These are my husbands favorite shoes. Not only are they hard to find but usually sooooo expensive. The quality is outstanding and my husband claims that they are so comfortable. He loves them and wears them everywhere!
"adidas probly my third pair, they need to be broken in a little, but once they are they are super comfortable and last a very long time. great shoe for soccer or any other sport/activity, working out, and working outside"
"adidas These Sambas turned out to be super comfortable, but only after I messed with them. I bought these in a size 6.5, and I am a women's size 8. They are slightly long, but narrow. I find the width to be just snug enough, and very comfortable, but I can imagine they might not be great for someone with wide feet. Also, the long tongue is kind of weird, but I can live with it. The real issue for me was the arch support. The arch was way too high, to the point that it really hurt. I figured I just needed to break them in, and wore them around the house for a few days. Then I wore them to soccer practice for a couple of hours, which was a big mistake. I got terrible blisters, and could not even put them back on without killing my feet. I thought I would have to return them, which was disappointing, because otherwise, I liked them. Then I did some searching, and I found this YouTube video, which shows you how to take out the sole lining, and remove the ridiculous foam arch piece that is glued in underneath.<br/>[...]<br/>I was a little doubtful, but I gave it a try, which was a really good decision. My sambas immediately felt a thousand times better, with just the right amount of support. They are now one of my most comfortable pairs of shoes, and I was able to wear them the whole soccer season. I also often wear them to school, because they're cute too.<br/>Bottom line- take out the arch support, and these are awesome soccer and everyday shoes."
"adidas fit better than expected, also very comfortable"
adidas My shoes came wayyyy sooner than i expected and they are perfect. Couldn't be happier with the decision. I even bought 2 pair lol
adidas I chose the samba because I will be traveling on vacation and playing soccer. This is a make I used before and I think it is the best shoe for sport.  Simply using it I think I will be showing to my friends the motives of my choice.
adidas Best sneakers I've ever worn! They look great too! I'm so gad I bought them!
adidas perfect. my husband wears nothing else so these always have to be excellent.
adidas I had a pair of the hemp sambas that fit perfect so I expected these to fit the same. Unfortunately these are a bit narrower for some reason. I'm not sure why and I wish they sold the hemp versions on amazon.
adidas They were not the right size but i think they are adorable. Returned for another pair
"adidas This is the second pair of these shoes I have bought. The first pair lasted 2 years of constant use before I finally wore a hole in the toe.  Overall great shoe, I normally wear an 11 but this size was a little small for me."
"adidas These run a little bit small, but it will probably only bother you if you have a wide foot (arch section is fairly narrow)--my feet are not exceptionally wide and so these shoes are comfortable enough at my standard shoe size. Going up 1/2 size would probably be wise for most people.  These shoes look amazing and the finish, stitching, and quality are all excellent. The Samba offers a great retro/classic look, yet the styling is still very current/trendy.  Truly a timeless design--I get more comments on these shoes than other pairs I own which cost 3X as much. These shoes are not the most comfortable pair I own (though they're comfortable enough), but they're easily one of the coolest--Adidas delivers."
adidas Great shoes!! Just replacing some old ones.
"adidas Fit perfectly, same quality as always. 4th pair of Sambas"
adidas Fit as expected. good for indoor soccer games. I like it.
"adidas Great, classic shoes that fit well -- I love them. I luve them. I luff them with two F's."
adidas Great shoes at a great price! classic and very fashionable at the same time
adidas Love the CLASSIC !  they fit so much better than the others!
"adidas For an everyday wear, these shoes are very comfortable and look really nice."
adidas Great product i loved it though they fit a bit too big but that is because i got half a size bigger.
adidas My favorite classic sneakers
"adidas This was a gift, replacing an older pair, exactly the same."
adidas Love these shoes mainly use them for indoor soccer hard floor only NO TURF  but they are so lite and comfortable I use them as my casuals also.
"adidas I Love these shoes! They fit well. A little roomy which is fine because I wear them when I'm out and about, not for exercise.  I plan on buying a black pair next time."
adidas My son has to wear orthotic insert. These take them well and fit as expected. Second time we bought this exact shoe.
"adidas I've owned Sambas for years, and these just FEEL different than they used to. Cheaper, flimsier, smaller, and less comfortable. Very disappointing!"
"adidas Narrow shoe so, if you have wide feet, look elsewhere."
"adidas Great product, you can't beat Samba for indoor soccer!"
adidas Mega classic
"adidas Excellent indoor soccer shoe, also excellent as an everyday shoe"
adidas My high school son wears these often and he loves them.
adidas Seems to run small compared to most shoes. I have been wearing them for years and they are comfy despite not having a ton of cushioning.
"adidas Super comfortable, short break in time, a great shoe for the money!"
adidas These shoes are amazing I love them I bought to pairs brand new great shape can't beat samba's
adidas Great quality! I wear them for rugby and soccer. Or out and about. I wear a 10.5 in most of my shoes. These fit PERFECT at a 10.5.
"adidas Authentic retro style, very comfortable and durable."
"adidas Great sneakers, excellent price, excellent seller!!!"
"adidas Awesome price, quick arrival. What more can you say?"
adidas Exactly what I expected.
adidas I love these shoes but I'm a size 7 and the size seven for this shoe is a little smaller than a regular 7 so maybe try ordering it half a size larger than your usual size
adidas AWESOME!!!
adidas Nothing like the classics! These sambas are 100% genuine. Look great and comfortable! Class!
"adidas Love these shoes. This makes my 3rd pair in the last 10 years and might I say this is the best. These fit better and even have a bit of a shape difference. Easily cleanable with soap and water, lasts a long time."
"adidas Nice made shoes, but they run narrow."
adidas Perfect for doing squats and deadlifts! (Very flat)
adidas Really happy!! Thanks!!
adidas I've been wearing them off and on for 20 years. They're dope.
"adidas Comfortable, durable, and look great. I use them to play airsoft indoor and out. And I can go for days in these. Love these, they'll last you forever"
adidas These are great shoes. You cant go wrong with a clasic. I look sexy AF!
adidas There's a lot more arch support than I remember from my youth soccer days. Great for my indoor soccer needs.
adidas Best pair of shoes I have ever owned for everyday wear and outdoor activities.
"adidas I like them, this kind with the soccer tongue has more arch support than the kind with the casual tongue. Some may not like it."
adidas My son has worn Sambas for the past 10 years.  They are a staple.  We are constantly buying new ones as his feet grow.
adidas Since I almost exclusively wear and have been wearing Adidas for over 40 years I know they run a half size smaller than American brands. (e.g. - I wear 10.5 shoes but with Adidas a US 11 fits the same.)
adidas Fast shipping &amp; Great shoe!! Love it
adidas Too skinny
"adidas Looked great!  Getting a different size.  Sizing didn't match my other pair, having to get a half size larger."
"adidas Always comfortable. Dear shore buyers, stop using American sizes. They are erratic. Euro and cm seems to always be reliable."
adidas Great shoe perfect fit and amazing shipping speed
adidas Classic shoe. I've had 3 pairs of these over the course of 10 years. Been wearing them since high school and one pair lasted me all through college.
adidas I've maybe owned ten pairs of these over the years. Always comfortable and well made.
adidas Awesome pair of shoes!!!!!! Super happy I got these at such a great price!!!!!
adidas The classic comfortable feel with the classic look
"adidas Timeless classic.  I know they make the Sambas with short tongues, but I like these better.  Great fit, comfy, and stylish.  What more can you ask for?"
adidas I love these shoes but I know Addidas runs small. I normally wear a 9.5 US mens size. These I bought a 10 because of the narrowness of them.
"adidas I wear those shoes up on the roofs. They are perfect.They are light, durable and have a very good grip."
adidas My son just transition from children sizing to adult sizing. The adult shoes have a much longer tongue than the children's version. That was fun with my son.
adidas Great shoe. Glad to have a pair back on my feet
"adidas A bit snug, but still fits well. Love the shoe."
"adidas Awesome soccer shoes both to play soccer or use to go to the gym, it is very beautiful."
adidas I have worn Sambas my whole life and try not to wear anything else.  Love them!
adidas Love them.  Size was the size I expected.  Same as the ones in stores
adidas nice
"adidas One looks new (color) other one is like color less , but I don't care because is for play indoor soccer tho"
adidas I love those Adidas samba soccer shoes they are the best and i got them for a good price online and they came so fast so is was so happy and i'm wearing them all day long there was worth buying
"adidas great shoes, perfect for all types of activities."
"adidas I bought this due to good product reviews but this was awful! it hurts my feet every time I wear them. I got my ankle twisted with this for the first time after 30 years! I wear it some times with two socks but it still hurts skin so bad, it doesn't provide any support! just awful! you cannot shoot properly with it if you are used to good quality shoes. After two month of use it is still awful! Just waste of money!"
adidas Good shoes after removing the arches. Its simple to take them off and in my opinion makes it a more comfterable shoe.
"adidas These shoes wear amazing for kids who destroy shoes and look great with the Tirol training pants, looks Maradona?"
adidas I play indoor with these once a week. The only reason im not giving 5 stars is because breaking them in was a pain.
adidas I have zero clue how many of these I've bought over the last few decades.
adidas they fit well but i was not aware the tongue was so long. i dont know what im supposed to do with it. do i fold it down? tie my laces behind it?
adidas Favorite shoe. I literally buy on every two years as I wear the old pair out. They are extremely comfortable for people with low arches.
adidas I normally wear a nine but an 8 1/2 would fit me better. But I played in these and it was no problem. Love these shoes.
"adidas Great all whatever whatever shoes, seem super durable and are very comfortable. The tongue is enormous so keep that in mind, and there is no traction whatsoever on smooth wet floors. But I mean, other than that fantastic."
adidas This is my youngest son's favorite shoes. I think this is his 2nd pair.
"adidas at first they were too tight but after 3 or 4 times used, they start too feel somewhat comfortable"
"adidas Love these shoes. Best everyday comfort shoes for me. Love the arch support as well. You never know when you'll be called to be a sub in a pick up soccer game, but with these you're prepared"
adidas I like the shoes but they are a bit small.  They can be wider.  I use them often but do notice the tightness occasionally.  They are breaking in and can be worn with anything.  It is a classic look.
adidas The best shoes ever made. So comfortable! I wear them everyday.
"adidas Great value! Fit as expected and has lasted me through the winter. They can get dirty easily, but a simple wet towel will take away the majority of the stains."
adidas My dad absolutely loved the shoes. Got if for him for christmas and he's been wanting these shoes for years now. Finally got the chance to buy them and they are perfect. The sizing was exactly how I wanted and the shipping time was good. I totally recommend buying them!
"adidas I started wearing these back in middle school. im close to 30 now. These are my everyday shoes. I have a rotation, one gets old so they become my yard work shoes while the new pair becomes the everyday shoe."
"adidas good shoes, very durable, at first they hurt my feet to wear."
adidas Good shoes for indoor soccer - have tried other brands but always come back to what works: the classics!
adidas Bringing it old school. Love this classic style.
"adidas excellent shoes, as always."
"adidas great product, not easy to find on stores"
"adidas No idea why this shoe has stuck w/ me for so long...The design, the construction, the fact that it reminds me of days gone by? Who knows, but they have.<br/>I always mod these by puncturing the tongue about 1.5"" from the top to that I can shorted the height of it (so it doesn't hang out so far).<br/><br/>Great shoe...you won't regret purchasing them"
"adidas good shoes, kind of narrow (I have wide feet though).  They stretch a lot!"
"adidas Bought this style for years. It's tough, comfortable, and wearable w/ about anything."
adidas I have bought many pairs of these over the years..Favorite shoes ever!!!
"adidas for long time adidas samba is my favorite shoe...comfortable, fresh, LOVE IT"
adidas Love these shoes. Been wearing Sambas for years. I work on my feet for over 8 hours a day. Provides great comfort.
adidas Soooo comfy I could die. If I didn't like wearing boots so much I would wear these everywhere.
adidas i use these for kung fu. love them very flat. love them for that
adidas Good shoe that my son likes for futsol.
adidas Great shoes
"adidas These Adidas Men's Samba Classic Soccer Shoes,Black/Running White,12 M really live up to their name!  Having not worn the Adidas brand in the past, I took a chance based on the strong heritage of the name.  In ancient Canadian mythology Adidas was the god of speed - many legends tell of Adidas' innumerable wins at the mythological gods track meets.  While participating in the shot put, hammer throw, and javelin, his true, god-given skill was in the sprint distances where he never lost a race!  His advantage, of course, was the third leg - neither mortals nor two-legged gods could compete against his speed.  Interestingly enough, this is the origin of the Adidas three stripes.  Originally there were three legs depicted on each shoe but over the years the legs were stylized to the current day three plain stripes.<br/><br/>Samba, of course, is the god of dance in French Canadian mythology.  Although there were truly heroic attempts to unify the French Canadian and Standard Canadian mythology in the years before the reign of King Winnipeg, they were sadly, unsuccessful.  Even to this day you can find French Canadian Mythology believers in the city of Quebec and some outlying areas.  (Quebec, of course being the French Canadian god of stubbornness and lost causes.)<br/><br/>The Adidas Men's Samba Classic Soccer Shoes,Black/Running White,12 M represent the perfect melding of these two mighty gods.  When you combine the speed of Adidas with the dancing skills of Samba you get soccer!  While other parts of the world refer to the mighty sport of soccer as ""football"" both the USA and Canada prefer to use the ancient term ""Soccer"".  The etymology of the word ""soccer"" is in itself an interesting tale.  ""Soc"", coming from the inuit ""sook"", or suck as we would say today.  ""Cer"" is a phonetic adaptation of Colonel Sanders of KFC fame.  Thus with the combination we have a ""Sucking Colonel"", or more properly a ""Colonel that doth suck"".  From there it's a short skip and a jump to today's stars of international soccer.<br/><br/>I am a flight surgeon and as such, have absolutely no hesitation in recommending the Adidas Men's Samba Classic Soccer Shoes,Black/Running White,12 M.  You won't go wrong!"
"adidas My husband loves these shoes he has been wearing them for years.  Not an all day, walking around Disneyland kind of shoe though!"
adidas I've  owned adidas samba before and I will continue to buy them. They are very comfortable and affordable.
"adidas My grandson loves them, he is 11 and fits perfectly, well made"
"adidas I like the shoes, but it will take a little time to break them in and grow into them."
"adidas A little narrow, had to break them in but overall very good for the price"
adidas Great shoes.  I always get these.  They're not really supposed to have much arch support.. but I like my shoes that way.
"adidas Fits too small, quality not the best. Didn't care for the sole."
adidas Shipping took as long as it said it would...which is unusual for Amazon normally everything I get arrives early.  Great shoes great price.
adidas Best shoes in the world.
"adidas Fit a little big, 1/2 more, but i love these the most"
adidas A classic.
adidas I love these adidas shoes they fit well and look cool and are comfortable. The only thing is that the shoe tounge is a bit long.
"adidas Love these shoes, I can use them to play indoor soccer and for regular use. These are my second pair"
adidas I love the styling of these shoes. They seem to be not even a half size too big from the last pair that I bought though(typically wear a size 10) so there is some extra room in the toes.
adidas We're somewhat tight.  Maybe was the way I laced them but awesomely kewl set of kicks.
adidas Good shoes good quality
adidas Arrived just in time. Looked great!!!
adidas My husband loves sambas. Great price!
adidas Very nice
adidas Great fit
"adidas Tongue is way too big, so be prepared to mod it. Size wise, you should order at least a half size larger than you normally wear; trust me on that."
adidas The new smell was a little strong of rubber
adidas Most comfortable sneakers you will ever buy
adidas I use these shoes as a gym shoe.  I am also a strongman competitor and you will not find a better shoe for the sport.
adidas ordered a half size up
adidas Met expectations! My son loves them!
adidas I knew the tongues were longer when I bought them - so this wasn't a surprise.  But I'm just not a fan of the longer tongues.  I wish I had bought a different Samba style with a normal tongue length - Samba Originals or Samba Millenium.
"adidas I got them for my self so ordered them one size less (I'm 7.5, ordered them 6.5) they fitted perfectly."
"adidas My all-time favorites for work or play. These look great, feel great and last forever!"
adidas great classic shoes.  fits as expected.
"adidas I used to wear Sambas when I played indoor soccer in the winter. They're very comfortable. Now I just wear them as my slip-on hang-out shoes. Package arrived: the shoe box looked like someone beat it with a golf club, but the shoes were un-damaged."
"adidas Great shoes, cheap, but don't feel it.  Excellent grip on turf, good grip on most other surfaces."
adidas Title says it all. I had a pair of Nike sneakers that finally bit the dust after 4 years so I ordered these bad boys. After some breaking in they're by far my most worn shoes - they're ridiculously comfortable and the understated black design goes with almost anything I'm wearing. The huge 'tongue' can be annoying but it also makes these shoes very easy to slip into without having to untie the laces.
adidas Grandson was happy on Chirstmas day
adidas AMAZING
"adidas Squeaked at first, just have to wear them around a bit"
adidas They look nice. Feel good but run a little large. I got a size 11 as usual but would do better half a size less.
adidas Absolutely love the Samba Classics.  Such a clean and perfectly designed shoe.  Arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Highly recommended!
"adidas Love Sambas. This new version is a little tight around my wide feet, but I have owned many pairs and know that you only need to break them in well. Love the arch support."
adidas Shoe fit nice except for the high arch.
"adidas size is just fine, but they are a little narrow at first... but stretched out just fine"
"adidas This shoe is made out of quality materials, which you will be as soon as you place them on your feet and take a few steps.  Be aware that these sambas come with an extended lip.  Personally, I think it looks great."
adidas I got them for my son because these are the only type he'll wear.
adidas Samba loyal for decades so I'm pretty bias.  These seethe real ones!
adidas Perfect !!!!!! üëçüèª
adidas The shoe is made extremely well and can take a lot of wear and tear
adidas good
"adidas While the sneakers themselves were fine, the tongue was very long and kept hitting my leg.  I reordered the Samba with the short tongue in order to avoid this issue."
adidas love this shoe
"adidas Really good shoes , i have used for years and i like them i say to buy a pair they are really good"
adidas The soles apparently last forever for skateboarders!
adidas They generally run narrow.  I went half a size up.
adidas Awesome that's all I have to say
adidas Good fit. Comfortable. Nice look
adidas I wish I could review the shoes but unfortunately a size 14 is still way too small for my foot. I will have to return them because they are too tight.
"adidas I did have to break them in a bit, but otherwise there is a reason why they are classics."
adidas All that I wanted
"adidas Fast shipping, will order again"
adidas Great classic adidas shoes. Would buy again.
adidas A lot narrower then my last pair. But I'm sure they will stretch out. Good price. Happy with order
adidas Greatt and great deal makes me look european
adidas I have worn Sambas for over 25 years and I can say they are one of my most favorite athletic shoes. While not ideal for every athletic endeavor they are a great all-around shoe - highly durable and reasonably inexpensive.
adidas Classics.... you get what you expect here.
adidas classic style and fit as expected. size 6.5 fit perfect for a womens 8. no breaking in needed.
"adidas classic, owned many pairs, perfect"
"adidas order one size up, I use it for weight lifting, squats, etc. Also use it to wear around town. Very nice looking shoes"
"adidas These shoes definitely lived up to the hype I've heard raved about these shoes the past 7 years. Love them, never going back to any other casual year-round shoes ever. These are by far the most comfortable, versatile, and all-round good indoor/turf shoes you can get for the money."
"adidas My husband has been wearing Sambas forever!  His latest pair wore out and I ordered these to replace.  Same classic shoe, just brand new.  He loves these and when they wear out he uses them to mow the lawn and replaces with new."
"adidas This is like my 5th pair of Sambas over the past 15 years.  The fit and feel are as reliable as always, with the same durable construction."
adidas Good shoes but I had to change the insole.
adidas Shoes fit great
adidas Love the shoes.
adidas great classic samba as always
adidas https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0008GQD2A/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
adidas Bought this pair size 13 for my brother. He loved them and fit perfectly!!
adidas The classic - been around forever
adidas So far love it
adidas Great fit. Arrived as expected with no complaints.
adidas Great shoes. I'm 47 and it's nice to wear shoes from the day that are so practical.
adidas Great fit and I love the look of these shoes. Much better price than you can find them and they arrived within reasonable amount of time.
"adidas It is Ok, but don't feel like leather"
"adidas Great for soccer or just as a walking shoe, too.  Great price."
adidas The best soccer shoe ever! This is my fourth pair of Sambas in 25 years and I am too thrilled to have the back. Stylish and comfortable as ever.
adidas Looks great I really like the look of these shoes.
"adidas looked good, seemed of solid make. arch felt good. shoes were too small and i had to return them."
"adidas Great shoes. Definitely take some breaking in. The arch is pretty significant and they are pretty narrow shoes, so they fit snugly on your foot, but are not uncomfortably tight anywhere. Once they are broken in they fit perfectly."
"adidas These shoes fit well, comfy, classic style.<br/><br/>This is my fourth pair and they have lasted me for about two years each. Would definitely recommend, great for the price."
adidas I got a size 7 but itshe a little too big.
"adidas Great shoe, looks good on."
adidas Great Shoes!
adidas Perfect size and quick shipping! I would recommend to everyone!
"adidas I have wide feet and these shoes are a bit too narrow, They are tolerable when I add arch support."
adidas The best shoes I own now!
adidas good. just as expected!!!
adidas Great shoes
adidas Great shoe.
adidas One of the most comfortable good quality shoes that will last you this shoe is the most bang for your buck.
"adidas I'm incredibly picky when it comes to shoes. They need to be durable, but also provide comfort. The classic Samba's are everything you remember. They will have holes in the heel before they fall apart, but that's usually after a year of daily use. I stopped hunting for new shoes and now I just order these once a year."
adidas These are a must have for indoor soccer.  Playing on a gym floor with these is a pleasure now as I was using a running shoe.  Just have to wear them in a bit to get a softer touch.
"adidas Flexible sole provides comfortable foot bottom and has gripping pattern on the bottom. inside of the shoe  hold feet comfortably snugly.‚Äã Never actually wear them for soccer or even tie them but they are durable, casual and great walking shoes."
"adidas These shoes rocks. There's a reason why they've been around for so long and are still receiving attention.  After playing around 5 games of soccer with mine, I decided I like them and was going to wear them as casual shoes and buy cleats. After all that running, tackling, jumping...they still look clean. Solid shoes. I just ordered the white and green version."
"adidas Very good show,  however, I'm not sure that it is 100% authentic Addidas.  The white stripes started to discolor on one side shortly after wearing them."
adidas Good shoes fast delivery
adidas Sambas are the greatest.
adidas great - my boy loved it!
adidas These are awesome! And they were such a great price.
"adidas Very comfortable, great looking, and a great price.  I'm extremely pleased."
"adidas These last a long time, and my son likes them!<br/>He wears them just about every day of the year.<br/>He's on his third pair. He grew out of the first two pairs, but they are all still wearable, with good soles."
adidas I have purchased dozens of pairs of these over the years.  My older son and my younger son like them for different reasons. I like them because they are durable :)
adidas Never go wrong with Sambas.
adidas Great shoes for nearly all occasions!
adidas Fit and style are both excellent
"adidas It fits a bit loose, the inside is very uncomfortable the arch of the shoe sole is positioned wrong... It should either be flat or curved properly."
"adidas Love the shoe, but it took a pretty long while for me to break them in. At first, the soles that come with the shoe really hurt my feet. After about a month, though, I didn't notice it as much. But I love the classic look!"
adidas Classic design and great comfortability. Granted I use mine for powerlifting which works great for it flat soles and grip.
adidas Good quality. This are great for walking or playing indoor soccer.
"adidas They look very nice, however for me they are too narrow and I can only wear them for a few hours.  I also had to get a peer of super feet to put in them."
"adidas Great fit, looks great"
adidas My family loves these!
adidas My husband loves these shoes and wears them to work everyday in the hospital.  his shifts range from 9-12 hours and his feet are not sore after work at all.
adidas My husband has been wearing and will only wear these shoes when wearing jeans.
"adidas Came quickly. Great condition, and actually fits snugly."
adidas Perfect
adidas Only issue i have is that they only come in the two colors. Very comfortable though.
"adidas I bought this shoe for my daughter's indoor soccer practice this year. I was surprised that they fit, true to size, and were a great price compared to brick and mortar stores."
adidas I love to wear Sambas as my everyday shoe. And I'm ready to break out in a soccer game at any time! Thanks Adidas!
adidas These are my favorite shoes in the whole world... even though I have fat feet and these pinch my toes together :(
adidas Great shoe. Great classic look. Bought them for my 12 year old. Just a tad smaller than expected.
adidas They run a little small and a little narrow. Decent comfort. Fair product for price.
"adidas I've had every color of Adidas Sambas except the blue and the white.  I was reluctant to purchase the white because they're bright, large-looking, and get dirty too easily.  But now that I've purchased these, I'm so impressed! These white Sambas are unique and stylish, definitely suitable for casual or athletic activities."
adidas I love the shoes.  They were too small so I had to return them.  I will be ordering a larger size!  The return was super easy to take care of with Prime.
"adidas The new arch support definitely wasn't good, but I found a video on YouTube on how to remove them and it was an easy fix. Just takes 5 minutes. Definitely worth it"
adidas You can never have too many pairs of Adidas Samba
adidas Used for my scout cosplay.
adidas happy with my sambas
adidas This is the same shoe I wore playing indoor soccer 35 years ago.... it is the iconic Samba!<br/>Loving It!
adidas Great!
"adidas This show is very comfortable. I wore a different version of this shoe years ago, it lasted a very long time. The best shoe made by Adidas ever!"
adidas Nice shoes but size runs a bit smaller.
"adidas I have plenty of Samba Classic Shoes in other colours and have had several black ones in the past.  I purchased a size 9 since my red ones were also a size 9; however, these are about half a size too big."
adidas Looks and fit great
adidas Tongue is too long so it rubs on the ankle. I got the other Samba style with the blue-label tongue. Much more comfortable!
adidas I'm not happy with it
adidas These are my favorite shoes.  I literally wear them until they fall apart.
"adidas Love Sambas, and this is a great price!"
"adidas These are identical to the shoes Urban Outfitters sells for quite a bit more, so I was thrilled to find them on here. They run a little larger than most shoes (about a size), so that's something to consider when ordering them online. Otherwise, no complaints. They were exactly what I expected."
adidas Just as described!
adidas Fake
adidas Nice
adidas Awesome shoes and super fast delivery - might be my best amazon purchase ever.  Perfect!!!
adidas I wear them to the gym and the provide all the support I require.  I will purchase them again.
adidas Nice piece of kit
adidas my boyfriend wears these all the time and he loves them!
adidas My go to pair of shoes are these adidas samba classic with the long tongue. Under heavy use a pair will last me 2-3 years. I have owned a few pairs of these since 2007 and I will probably continue to purchase this shoe for many years to come.
adidas Great all around shoe. Comfortable and a great looking shoe!
adidas Great shoes for a great price. My 10 yr old loves them and was thrilled when the arrived earlier than expected.
adidas Very comfortable
"adidas Shoes quality is quite good<br/>The soles are a little too hard<br/>Play while you can wear, also can wear to work<br/>My husband was pleased with the shoes"
adidas I just keep buying them! I am usually a 10 Wide and I have to buy the Sambas on size 11
"adidas Shoes look cool.<br/>They're a little narrow, they should strech and feel just right."
"adidas Comfortable, classic look, perfect shoes"
adidas We order this every year for gym shoes
adidas Always will love the classic sambas. Will by more when the time comes.
"adidas Bought a size 12, shoulda bought a half size bigger"
adidas Love this shoes
adidas Nice. Very Good
"adidas Happy with the shoes, fitted as expected"
adidas Met expectations
"adidas Wish I order size wide, however overtime it will expand."
adidas Very Good Product!!
"adidas These shoes have that classic slender and minimal look to them.  I read the questions and answers before reading reviews, and I had no issue folding the lengthy tongue over and lacing up on more eyelet.  There is a very noticeable arch in the shoe and provides an indication of how the shoe actually fits.  There is a definite minimalist feel, but it is like a hybrid shoe with the amount of pronounced arch support it has.<br/><br/>I wear a 12D in most shoes and some said they ran small.  I disagree.  I ordered a 12 and they will break in perfectly.  These are some long last dependable shoes and I will continue to provide updates as they break in.<br/><br/>As a comparison of how they fit as compared to other brands<br/>Saucony - 12<br/>Chuck Taylor All-Stars - 11<br/>Mizuno - 12<br/>Clarks - 12<br/>Brooks - 12<br/><br/>I was searching for comparisons and couldn't find any - I am always skeptical about ordering shoes online.  I mostly wear a 12 with a comfortable thumb width of open space at the end of the shoe.<br/><br/>2-2-16 I have worn only these shoes for the last 4 days.  That includes work, exercise, casual events, etc.  I am very happy with my purchase."
adidas They're great!
adidas 8th grade kid loves the classic style and fit of these shoes. Sizing was easy and went as expected since we just locally sized and purchased adidas basketball shoes.
adidas Love these shoes !!!
"adidas Quality shoe, arch support way to much. Im a fan of the minimus style of footware however."
"adidas The fit is slightly narrow for what I expect for a ""D"" width shoe, but it is still comfortable to wear. Quality is very good overall and I expect that the fit will improve as they break in."
adidas Love the look
adidas My grandson is very happy with them and that's about all I could get out of him!!
adidas They seem to be on the narrow side. The old classic were not like this before.
"adidas Great shoes. Super comfy. Look good, feel good, can't go wrong with AdiDas."
"adidas I like this shoe, and I have owned 5 pairs in the past 4 years. It is a little hard on the feet during the break-in period but quite comfortable afterward. Great multi-purpose shoe, but especially for soccer and for skateboarding."
adidas Very nice shoes
"adidas What can I say? Adidas knows how to construct a fine piece of footwear. Look at that style: nothing gaudy or unnecessary. Its beauty is derived from its superior function. That leather wrapped around your toes at the contact area? Useful and stylish. The grip pattern on the bottom? Superb. A tongue stronger than a sailor's? Unmatched.<br/><br/>This has to be my fourth pair by now and I just can't go back to any other kind of shoe. What always bums me out is when I have a nice-looking pair of shoes and they have some catastrophic failure of structural integrity. The wall tears. The rubber separates from the boot. This is just a non-issue for the Sambas. In every pair. EVERY. PAIR. I only buy a new pair because the grip on the bottom has worn down. The rest of the shoe, while a little scratched up and worn in, is still carrying on like its just getting warmed up. And this is after about a year. I got my last pair 10 months ago and the only noticeable wear is on two spots: One by the top-most eyelet on each shoe (because I sit cross-legged on concrete sometimes) and the sole of the heel. I think that's just because I walk heel-to-toe (I don't understand creeps who walk otherwise, but apparently that's a thing) and that's getting kind of thin. The first wear spot is purely cosmetic and barely noticeable, but the wear on the heel may be a problem in a few more months. I still have my last pair as throw-away shoes for mowing the lawn. The ""grip"" on the bottom is completely non-existent at this point, but come on, I've had them for like 3 or 4 years now. Can any other shoe match that? Yeah right.<br/><br/>TL;DR<br/>If you're tired of being a nostyle scrub, buy these. The bottom rubber will be the first thing to go after a year (maybe two!) of lots of walking / playing. I talk a lot about the grip wearing out, but that's because THAT'S ALL that ever really wears out! And it's only after about 1-1.5 years that you'll notice any wear, and it will be cosmetic."
adidas It's my 5th pair I love em
adidas These are my daily shoes and I love them. I've owned many pairs of Samba's over the years and these are a little on the narrow side.
adidas Great shoes.
adidas Great shoes.
adidas Husbands fav
adidas espectacular
"adidas I compared these to a pair of traditional sambas from a few years ago when they arrived and it isn't the same shoe. The dimensions are all wrong as not a single stitch lined up. Some of the material is slightly different and finished in a different way. If you didn't know sambas you wouldn't notice, but I did. Aside from the aesthetics the left arch support isn't formed to the exact same shape as the other shoe. It makes them so incredibly uncomfortable to walk in I use them as mud shoes. It almost seems like I got some sort of 'sweatshop' knock off. I also realize they could have been a single pair of crap shoes and the rest could be fine.<br/><br/>But they did send me shoes, so they get a star."
adidas Really nice my nice.love this.adidas
adidas The only sneaker that any grown man should be wearing that isn't for form.  Running shoes are for running.  Cross trainers are for the gym or basketball court.  Pick these (or possibly some Chuck Taylor's) to pair with your jeans on Saturday.
"adidas I love the way these shoes fit, but must be worn with socks for a truly comfortable fit."
adidas Fit and look awesomeqq
adidas Me gustaron
adidas great shoes
adidas Shoes are a little tight across the arch
adidas They are exactly as I expected. I use them as comfortable sneakers to wear daily. I am very hard on shoes and they have held up well.
adidas Perfect!!!!
"adidas Amazing product, great price, super fast shipping"
adidas never disappoints
adidas I have a few pairs of sambas. These fit differently and are uncomfortable.
adidas Excellent.
adidas All good!.
adidas great for indoor soccer
adidas I've been wearing this style shoe for over 15 years.  They are supportive and last over a year...and I wear them and walk at least 2 miles daily.
adidas My son has worn this same shoe style for around 10 years. They are comfortable and last. He loves them.
adidas Excellent
adidas Excellent
"adidas Great classic sneaker, haven't had a pair of these since I was a kid back in the 80's! Great price &amp; fast shipping! Highly recommended!"
adidas nice look. good feel. lumpy for my arch though. use to asics.
adidas I've been wearing these shoes since high school back in the early 2000's.  They never get old.  Tried and true.  I also like the white pair for summer time.
adidas Very happy with these shoes! I'm normally a size 8 in women's and got a size 6.5 in men's. They fit great and are very comfortable!
adidas My 17yo loves them
adidas Love ADIDAS
adidas Very comfortable ! Great price. Satisfied on my first purchase with Amazon.
adidas Shoes are great
adidas Classic shoe - I'm using them for general workouts as well.
"adidas Great fitting shoes. I have now switched these to becoming some of my daily footwear as they are just that comfortable. Additionally, the material feels great"
"adidas Best shoes for comfort, Great arch support!"
adidas I have had several pairs!!!
adidas Fit great
adidas I personally would have liked more cushioning support but at it is an indoor soccer shoe you get what you pay for.
adidas Theese shoes are a little narrow across the toes. Order a half size up.
adidas Last a long time
adidas They're sambas.  I'm not sure there is much more to add.
"adidas It's good shoes, just had to take the arch off with a knife and it's good now."
"adidas My last pair lasted six full years. Stylish, comfortable, multipurpose. What more could you ask for?"
"adidas Too small, I take 9.5 thanks"
adidas Love these shoes!
adidas Great!
adidas Thanks
adidas Favorite shoe i've ever owned.
adidas excellent
"adidas Very comfortable, love them!"
"adidas The toe box was pretty tight, and the top of the shoe creased differently on each foot, and my right shoe would crease harshly so that it would pinch my toes with every step. The arch support was also very high, but that might just be my foot type. Lastly, there was not a lot of padding, so it was pretty hard and stiff feeling."
adidas These are great shoes and I'll have them for a long time due to good quality.
adidas This is the second pair of white Sambas that I've purchased - both emanate a chemical smell that can't be bleached or febreezed out.
adidas Good product and price
adidas Laces are too short
"adidas Used like working shoes.1,5 year still going strong:)))"
adidas Shoes are great but the toe box is really narrow and the shoes seem smaller than actual size. I returned mine for a larger pair.
adidas Great
adidas The sambas fit great! They're light and comfortable which helps in indoor soccer. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to do indoor soccer but doesn't want to spend too much.
adidas my 7th pair love them!!
adidas Best shoe for the best price. My favourite purchase for myself in 2016
"adidas great casual pair of shoes for school, field, and everywhere"
adidas Good
adidas good
adidas nice
"adidas Ok, so my soccer days are a little past, but every man should have a pair. They aren't flashy, new, but they are always cool, but then again I ain't 19. You wont catch Beiber in them and that's fine with me.Go with everything, anytime, and anywhere."
"adidas This shoe is a bit awkward the first time you put it on, but after a couple wears it molds to your feet and becomes your favorite shoe.  It's stylish and comfortable, and fits for just about any occasion.  Try a pair."
adidas Looks great! The arch support can be a little much if your not used to that. The shoe itself was impressive!
adidas Great shoe for martial arts
adidas My husband loves the shoes. Great quality and the price.
adidas You never know when you buy shoes online but these fit ok and getting better by the day (and I have wide feet).
adidas Always great shoes. They never fail me.
adidas Great shoes. Never been as comfortable playing soccer. Build quality looks outstanding as well and is very light weight
"adidas Love these shoes, first time buying them and fits my feet like a glove. easy to wear and take off and very comfortable to walk with and drive with. Also looks good."
adidas A+
adidas ok
adidas Its like wearing comfortable slippers every where I go!
adidas Great shoe but the lifespan would be extended if you could replace the soles.  Especially those who use them for their designed purpose of indoor football.
adidas Love ! Fast shipping
adidas Great shoe! My husband wears these constantly. Item came as expected. We will continue to order even after these become worn.
adidas Adidas Sambas are the best sneaker ever made......only sneaker I continually buy over and over and over.
"adidas be warned, there is a reason these are cheaper, the leather is either low quality or fake.  I had a legit pair before and the leather formed much better and quicker to my feet, and lasted a long time (5+ years)"
adidas My son loves these shoes. He's using them as regular sneakers and for futsol.
adidas Purchased these shoes as a gift for my son.  He has worn Adidas samba's for years.  The shoes arrived on time and fit perfectly.
adidas Really enjoy them they look great and feel fantastic went a size up because my toes were crowded past that wonderful shoe
"adidas Classic look and performance, but not the best if you have low/no arches so, I use Superfeet Green insoles for added support."
"adidas I love these shoes! The support in them is excellent plus they give a casual/professional look, overall i am extremely satisfied with this purchase."
adidas best shoe ever
adidas Great!
adidas GREAT SHOES
"adidas 9.5 means 42.5Ôºåbut in fact ,it is 43and1/3,rather large."
adidas Felt big at first but after I broke them in they felt true to size. Comfy shoes
adidas Great shoe
adidas Good traction and material. They are a little narrow as is the case with many soccer shoes. They are designed to fit the foot structure of winkie boys.
adidas My son loves this soccer shoe for indoor training and games and also for everyday use.  Comfort and durability is #1 for us and for him.  Recommend to all.
adidas Best all around shoe I've ever worn.
adidas Comfortable good looking shoe
adidas My husband is in love with them.
adidas Great Classic shoe.
adidas bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them! cheaper proce than in stores too
adidas These shoes are the classic Addidas Sambas. The fit was true to size and the shipping was quick. My boyfriend wears them everyday and they haven't shown any wear or tear yet. I would buy myself a pair of these. They look good. Highly highly super highly recommend these shoes.
"adidas I had a pair of this same model for 15 years.  They finally blew out.  So I bought an exact replica lol.  I love the fact they haven't changed in 20+ years.  The arch is high on me, but for as often as I wear sneakers, these are what I was looking for."
adidas Great fit.
adidas The shoe seems to be smaller than the size I needed. they fit too little.
adidas Have always loved these shoes. Have worn them for years. Get a new pair and the old pair get rotated to work shoes!
"adidas I'm on my third pair of these shoes (classic) and LOVE them. They are the best shoes on the market for us men that teach Zumba on a gym floor (not carpet). They fit well, lots of support, and are easy to salsa in."
"adidas Great shoes, great price!"
adidas i like
adidas Good shoes
"adidas I love this shoes used them for years, I just bought another pair because old ones were wasted, I bought 9s because 9.5 fit too big and found myself in dissapointment that this ones are too small for being comfortable. BUt the product feels good."
adidas Bought these for my husband.  He said he likes them except for the fact that the tongue is the type that you fold over which he doesn't care for.
"adidas The shoes are for my son who had the very same ones,but totally wore them out. He's very happy with them. They were an ""extra"" Christmas present."
"adidas These shoes are great. Very comfortable, grippy, form fitting, yadda yadda yadda. It's just, the toe part is made from suede, and suede evidently hates water with a burning passion. Be aware. Don't make the mistakes I made."
"adidas Why change something that's not broken, been wearing sambas for the last 15 years with no complaints. They last forever and when its time to replace them, they are not hard to find and the price is always fair."
adidas excellent to play room soccer. good grip and comfortable.
adidas Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.<br/>Nothing more to say. Everything as described.<br/>Fit perfectly and delivery time was great as well.
adidas These run one size small like I have found true of Nike. They only took one day to break in; they have been very comfortable since.
adidas They are a classic for a reason... can't go wrong with some Sambas. Will be buying another pair to replace my 2 year old pair soon!
"adidas Bought these for weightlifting instead of soccer.  They work well -- good arch support, solid sole, and nice, flat heel  Really helped out my squats."
"adidas Good, but I have had 3 pairs of these exact shoes over the last year and for some reason this pair is a little smaller... hoping they stretch out."
"adidas These shoes are perfect, and I don't like wearing any other shoes."
adidas good i like
"adidas I love these shoes! I've bought them twice for my husband. They fit well, are useful for many occasions, and have also lasted well (two years, I think)."
adidas not as confy as skechers but I like them.
"adidas These shoes surprisingly support my feet. I have pretty high arches and these are better than some running shoes as far as snugness and support in the right places.Supremely comfortable. These are only made in men's sizes but one size smaller was fine.I'm glad I went for it, they are well made and will hold up for a long time.<br/>I say go for it!"
"adidas These shoes are the best you can get for indoor soccer. Stylish and sporty, it's worth the investment."

adidas I have been buying sambas for years and they never disappoint.
adidas I bought these shoes for my boyfriend for his indoor soccer club. He says that they fit as expected and are comfortable. He would recommend this shoe to any indoor soccer player.
adidas The shoes are alright. They seem to be cheaply made to me. Wish I would of ordered something else. I will wear them anyways since I payed 55 bucks for them. The shoes came on time so that's why I gave 3 stars.

adidas Ordered wrong size.

adidas Love these shoes. Rocking them at work and made head turn.

adidas Classy shoe!
adidas Fix well
adidas Comfortable nice looking shoes. Well worth it. These shoes are cooler than they look in the picture in person! For Adidas lovers it's worth it. Nice gold samba writing on side and gold Adidas inside.
"adidas True to size, comfortable, and appear to be well made"
adidas I bought those shoes for my son!!  And I love them!!  He looks very handsome!!  :)

adidas My favorite shoes
"adidas Well made shoe, long tongue though"
"adidas It is a little narrow, but a classic shoe that looks good with just about any outfit.  Can't go wrong with this one."

adidas I like samba
"adidas I was looking for a pair of soccer shoes (without spikes) that I could use for practices / work-outs, etc. The old reliable Sambas fit the bill--comfortable from the start with above average support and traction. A good pair of shoes to have in your bag."
adidas The best pair of shoes I have worn in my whole life. The online price was also much lower than the store prices. Thanks.
adidas I buy one pair after the other. I know my size and know what to expect so I can buy them online no problem.
adidas the king of shoes
adidas They weren't big enough
"adidas Sambas, they're the original classics."
"adidas These are my sixth pair of size 11 sambas, so I obviously like the shoe. However, this pair is bit narrower than past pairs, and it just has me concerned about quality control."

adidas love adidas shoes
"adidas It's classic slim and good designed, however when I am wearing it, the instep position of my foot somehow feels a little uncomfortable."
adidas Love it
"adidas Was told to buy a size bigger and unfortunately this just doesn't work. Stick with either your regular size or, at most, a half-size bigger."
adidas The Shoes I bought are for my Son cannot answer your Questions.But it is his second Pair and I assume they fit fine.Ursula

"adidas Classic Adidas shoe, doesnt disappoint."
adidas Perfect
adidas Great Shoes I have owned several pairs of sambas over the years and the are great for me.. These came super fast and where exactly what I ordered.
adidas I recommend these shoes for casual wear.  Not for sports or running though because they have flat bottoms.  You still can run in them though.  Just not as good as running shoes.  They are very comfortable though.
"adidas Excellent pair of shoes, they are very comfortable and lightweight. Definitely do recommend them.I'm buying my son a pair as well."
"adidas My son is very happy with his Samba's. We had a heck of a time finding his size, so I was more than happy to pay a little more than what Academy usually sells them for to get the right size."
adidas All good
adidas So good for the price
"adidas Great design, and a classic."
"adidas Excellent shoes. I keep these on rotation, the newer pair I use for indoor soccer, and the older pair for street wear.  Extremely comfortable for people with wide/flat feet. My only complaint is that they stretch quite soon, and so do not last too long during  regular soccer playing."
adidas Received the shoes within a week of placing the order.  Recommend.
adidas Classic shoe I have owned since I was 12 years old.
adidas Awesome.. Fits perfect .. üëçüèæ!
adidas They are so comfortable!!!
adidas Good
"adidas good item, graeat price!"
adidas The shape of the shoe is too big.
"adidas Shoe is amazing. Only complaint is that they are a little squeaky, but you learn to tune it out."
"adidas Great shoes. Definitely take some breaking in. The arch is pretty significant and they are pretty narrow shoes, so they fit snugly on your foot, but are not uncomfortably tigh"
adidas Good buy
adidas Love the shoes.... For me Adidas shoes seem to run a bit small...ordered 11.5 and fit good... I have more size 11 shoes and boots
adidas Have bought Men's Samba Classic Soccer Shoes before (am still wearing one pair now) but the shoe that was sent was about .5 size too small. Disappointing.
"adidas Great price, great fit.  They come in fitting a little tight but they stretch pretty quick.  I love these shoes and for the price its hard to beat.  Plus, they are in style!"
"adidas I think I bought a size too big, I'm a 7.5 and bought an 8.5, so it was my fault but the shoe itself is kinda big still. Anyway 4 stars"
"adidas Adidas "" always the best "" high quality never disappointed."
"adidas Great shoes!!!They are comfortable and really nice. The shipping was great since I didn't have to wait much. I really recommend people, who like the look of these shoes, to get them."
adidas Great shoes.  Just as expected.  Happy with the price.

adidas Good product
adidas It's not the same as going to the store and trying them on. I got a half size larger but they still didn't fit.
adidas GREAT shoes!!!
adidas Perfect fit and extremely comfortable.
adidas One of my favorite shoes to wear hands down. Great looking for almost any occasion.
"adidas I love the sweet look and feel of these Sambas.  Best shoe I've ever purchased, which is why I've solely (pun intended) been buying these shoes for 15 years and counting."
adidas Great for indoor soccer!
"adidas About a year later and I'm still wearing these every day. They've held up well, with only a small amount of fraying on the back. The only down side is they have very thin soles. I'd recommend insoles for these shoes."
adidas great shoes with a great price
adidas My son loves these. I wish I could borrow them üòÇ
"adidas The sneakers are really comfortable and more beautiful than I expected. I bought them for my brother, and he loves them very much."

adidas Great shoes for casual wear.....just gotta have these shoes to complete a total woredrobe!!!. Thanks Amazon!!
adidas :)
adidas The best walking shoes. A legit german classic!
"adidas Good all around shoe for casual use. Not much in the way of padding or support though. As an avid footballer (soccer) I found this shoe to be inadequate for indoor use for a competitive player. The shoe performs decently for informal pickup games though. The price is just right, and the shoe runs true to size, although it may be to narrow for those with wider feet."
adidas Classic! Can't go wrong with a pair of Sambas!
adidas Excellent
adidas Son was very happy with them. So ways the price. Cheaper than anywhere else.
adidas Comfortable when broken in. They fit snugly and the arch support is pretty high.
adidas I've wore these same type of shoes since I was 13 or 14 and I'm 28 now.
adidas Amazon never fails when it comes to getting products to their consumers on time. Very pleased
adidas thumbs up.
adidas My son loves these shoes for indoor soccer
adidas My husband loves them!  I am so happy with the quality.
"adidas Fit great, look great"

adidas Shoes came on time. Very good product. They fit very well. Can't wait to see how long they last.
adidas Fits perfect and its light. Great for everyday use.  Awesome arch support. Adidas make quite the fine quality shoe. I have ton of Adidas shoes and you can never go wrong with the product they push out.
"adidas Wore the same sneakers as a child for indoor soccer. Great shoes, fit wells and are comfortable."
adidas As expected
"adidas I just got my shoes, right on time!!! the shoes were perfect, brand new, the sambas are probably the cutest, and best shoes ever, i am a girl and i got them because they will work with every outfit, also they are very comfy. But you should get a half size up, because they can be alittle snug. BUY THEM NOW!!!"
adidas Super comfy.

"adidas Best show I have ever worn. Comfortable, light, supportive, and still fashionable."

adidas Yes
adidas had a pair before and these are fine too
adidas USED SAMBAS FOR YEARS. GOOD FUTSAL SHOE AND ALL PURPOSE SHOE.
adidas Great shoe. Fits well. Wears well. Need inserts for arch support
"adidas I have worn various pairs of this shoe for decades, and they are always perfect. Like comforting slippers, but great for actual play."
"adidas I remember seeing these as a kid on my friend and some adults and thought to try them, I was a fan of Adidas as I loved the originals sneakers collection and one of my teachers had spoke about how the shoe felt like indoor cleats, I thought to finally try them.A great pair of shoes especially for the money, I probably wore these shoes over a thousand times too, to the point where there were holes and I had to get rid of them a few weeks ago. My first reaction when I got the shoes was that they were very light, at first you kind of have to break them in. They may seem a bit snug and may hurt a little bit. Perhaps it hurted me more than others because I have flat feet. After a week when you break them in, they sort of shape to your feet. It will feel comfortable and you'll feel as light as a feather, the shoes are great for athletics and they are very aesthetically pleasing, more so I liked how the shoe was rather versatile. If I wanted to wear some chinos, or some casual wear it wouldn't look to bad infact it would play the part. what I absolutely loved about these sneakers is how you can simply slip them on, I always hated those sneakers that you had to untie and worry about the shoe getting creases and what not. I however found that after a while, the shoe felt like it was slipping off and that it may have expanded during the time I was wearing, again nothing too big but it felt like it grew about 1/2 over the time I had it.  This became my go to shoe whenever I was leaving, I didn't even dare look at the others as my feet had gone through so much uncomfort when I went back. The shoe can get rather slippery in the winter and on wet areas so you need to be careful there but it's not like they're meant to be used during the winter. One of the things that I disliked about the shoe is how I had to keep on tying the laces several times, perhaps this had to with the laces mainly but I felt like it was the shoe moving from place to place as it started to expand and stretch. During the shoes last dying dies, I start to get holes from the ongoing times I've worn it, I knew it wouldn't last the way I treated it but for $40+ I didn't very much care. I later discovered that the inside of the shoes is composed of mainly some kind of cardboard, kind of surprising how such a comfortable fit could be made from such cheap material.<br/><br/>I would recommend these to a friend, perhaps you may not want to wear them as much as I did however if you plan on making them last but it's great and with a price like that. You can't really go wrong. Would I buy them again however, there are many other shoes in the market and I'm willing to try many and see where they take me but I will have flashbacks of all the events that I had with my pair of shoes. I never begun to adore a shoe like that, no matter how much damage and dirt and stretching it went through, it managed and still had an amazing authentic look."
adidas Price was right and its fits perfectly
adidas the best soccer shoe to date
adidas Good versatile shoe at a great price.
"adidas Super quality, great look, comfortable wearing.<br/><br/>I don't use them for soccer, but I'm sure they will do the job.<br/><br/>will buy this one again in future :)"
adidas Exactly what I remembered. A timeless classic that you can wear with jeans and t-shirt.
adidas These were a gift and are loved!
adidas Perfect !
adidas Great product at a great price. Quick shipping!
"adidas Maybe the uncomforatbility comes from the size,  because it is not quite fit my feet.  But anyway, it is a good shoes."
adidas Great every day shoe!! Will probably order another pair soon as long as the price stays low.
adidas Fits as expected. I love them
adidas Best shoes ever. Not clear why other companies don't make anything similar considering how great these are
adidas It's not I was espect
adidas Samba is probably the best shoe ever made
"adidas No wide sizes avail, too narrow"
adidas All was fine on my order and I would order again.
adidas Bought them for a Halloween costume and they were so comfy I was I had more occasions to wear them.
"adidas Husband knows his size, so ordering online works for this.  He wears them every day after he comes home from work."
adidas great product. great price
adidas Good soccer shoes

adidas Classic awesome style shoes! Same ones I owned in high school!
"adidas Sambas, the only sneaker for me."
adidas Delivery on time and merchandise fit perfectly. Thanks for making it happen.
adidas Dope ass kicks my dear.
adidas great!!
adidas fit perfect
adidas I've had Samba's in the past.  These were overly tight and narrow.
adidas Good show but a little long. If you wear a 10 maybe a 9.5 would be good
adidas I love it.
adidas Great shoe. Fast shipping. Fits perfect!
adidas Look great and I know they will last a long time. Might need some insoles done they are a bit firm for me.
"adidas The shoes are a little bit large for me. Plus, after once or twice wearing, I feel like my left foot tends to have a blister."
adidas my husband loves these shoes.. especially after being in iraq and coming back home he says they feel great on his feet after wearing combat boots for so long.. Shipping super fast i got them in 1 day wow thank you so much i will be ordering more of these for sure from you ...
adidas Great.
"adidas Classic fit, classic shoe. Comfortable, versatile, gets the job done and fits as you'd expect it to. Don't have any complaints."
"adidas 5 Stars for fast delivery and perfect condition Sambas. Super stoked on having a reliable Sambas shoe source other than the mall, which is about 30 miles from me. :D"
adidas Love this shoes.
adidas It is slightly small. Abit discomforting.
adidas runs a half size small.
adidas Classic samba. Can't expect to get a better shoe for less money.
adidas Great fit but paint is easy to scuff away
adidas I Love These Sneakers!!!!
adidas Looks
adidas Love it!
adidas I bought these shoes for my brother and he absolutely adores them. You can't find them in white in any Adidas store so it was nice that Amazon has it in the right color. That explains the slightly higher price than stores charge for the black color. The size is true to fit and it looks just like in the picture. You can't go wrong with a classic like this.
adidas I bought this for my son and he loves them. It looks good on him and he hasn't complained about the size or anything he likes it because it's very comfortable.
adidas This is my second pair of this shoe style I've bought. I absolutely love the style of Sambas and their perfectly casual and stylish for an occasion. I dont play soccer but when I wear these shoes im mistake as a soccer player all the time!
adidas What can I say about a shoe that's been around 50+ years that hasn't already been said? They're comfy. They're stylish. They're awesome. Buy some.
adidas I have a pair of Originals that have seen better days; they lasted 5 years. I don't know why it took so long to buy these to replace them. Always good looking and comfortable.
adidas You get what you pay for. Shoe is inexpensive and feels like it when you where them.
adidas Nothing to write home about...these shoes are narrow and the material is a little cheap. But their decent and although not too comfy....maybe they just need some wearing in. But they're just ok...although definitely not worth full price!
"adidas Nice looking sneaker but, a little narrow!!!!!"
adidas Love these shoes. I'll probably just re-order these exact ones for the rest of my life.
adidas Just fits right but not a very comforatable shoes. But I will not recommend to my friends because the cushion is not comfortable and not soft enough for every day walking.
"adidas Why change a classic?  I used to ear these in grade school, and if it ain't broke don't fix it.  Their stylish, comfortable and lightweight.  I will ear these for the rest of my life."
adidas I bought this for my husband. They are comfortable and casual.
adidas I like them.
adidas My brother loves this !!
"adidas Excellent, thanks!"
adidas They make these about a half size smaller than shoes in the past. I've always worn 7 1/2. Had to return for 8's.
adidas Great buy. Affordable and meets all expectation.
adidas Great soccer shoes !
"adidas I have wide feet, and narrowness wasn't an issue for this pair. Good purchase overall."
"adidas If you look for it, you'll see that there are a lot of folks out there who wear the Adidas Samba Classic.  (I'm one of them.)  The next time you see someone wearing a pair, ask them how long they've been a Sambas wearer.  In my life I've asked dozens of people, and I'd put the over/under on the answer at 10 years.<br/><br/>What is it about this shoe that makes people come back, pair after pair, for decades?  First off, they go with a lot of outfits.  When they're new, they're classy enough that you can even get away with them in a situation when you'd normally need dress shoes.<br/><br/>Next, they are comfortable.  Really, really, really comfortable.  The shoes come with a foam sole and a leather body that fit like a cardboard box when you first put them on, but in a week have completely molded to the shape of your foot.  It's an incredible feeling, like a custom shoe made just for you.  I've tried wearing my friend's Sambas in the same size, and boy was it weird.  Like a completely different shoe.  Not like ""Oh I can tell the difference"" weird, but ""Oh wow I need to take these off immediately"" weird.<br/><br/>The main downside to the Samba is that because they're so pliant they wear out pretty quickly.  If you wear them every day they probably won't last a full year before they start to look and feel beat up.  Fortunately they're very reasonably priced.  I get these 3-4 pairs at a time to save the hassle.  If you've never had a pair before, which you haven't if you're bothering with product reviews, I can't urge you enough to try them out."
adidas so cool
"adidas Perfect arch support, but toebox is small."
adidas 5 stars because something else wouldnt be fair. NOW... is the biggest fricking size 10 un the world.
adidas Great for indoor soccer
adidas Same as every other pair of sambas. That's why I bought them.

"adidas These shoes fit great!  I give them 5 stars as this is a classic, stylish shoe."
adidas fine
adidas Good stuff man..!
adidas Great Shoes.  Smaller than normal sneakers.
adidas Love them
"adidas classic shoe, same as it has been for years.  great shoe for soccer or just hanging out"
adidas Great shoes! I could use a pair that's a half size larger but they're still comfortable.
"adidas The right shoe is not wide enough, hurting my pinky toe and the shoes are pretty easy to rough up. Use with care."
adidas Great shoe at a great price!
adidas They're very narrow and the arches are too high.
"adidas Too large for size, arch is too high, and tongue is too large."
adidas Took a bit for me to get comfortable in these shoes. Once I did I wear them everywhere I go.
"adidas Great, economic and feel amazing on your feet. Ordered 3 pairs because I was so satisfied."
"adidas While the product was good, the shoe itself was too narrow and had to be returned."
adidas Not a big fan...I played with better more comfortable ones.
"adidas Great shoes, but Adidas brand seems to fit large on me compared to Nikes."
"adidas Where do I begin? These shoes are simply comfortable, stylish, and durable; that's all you need to describe them. I've gone through 4 pairs of them now wearing each of them for 3 years until they finally give up the ghost."
"adidas I tried these on at the store to figure out my size, because like boots, these shoes vary on size compared to your Nike or Reebok.  They are a little tight on the sides, but I was looking for a shoe that fit snug.  Also a reason that I got them was for the arch support that they offer.  Far more than most other shoes that I have bought."
"adidas Exactly what I expected, a great shoe"
adidas Wear them every day
adidas The shoes is somewhat comfortable.. but why the heck did they make such an enormous tongue?! it just cant get uglier.
adidas Ready Freddie...
adidas No complaints here
"adidas love sambas, they do require some breaking in, you might order slightly large."
adidas Awesome shoes!
"adidas My son loves these shoes.  They fit perfectly, are comfortable and supportive.<br/><br/>Highly recommend, order in your normal size.<br/><br/>Shipped quickly."
adidas I just ordered the wrong size. Once I up sized all was well.
adidas Bought these for my husband who wears them for either indoor soccer or for work. He loves them and gets a new pair every year. Fit true it size and prime delivery is the bomb.
adidas Love my Sambas. I actually have them on right now. Classic.
adidas Quality excellent. They seem to run just a tiny bit small.
adidas Good stylish shoes but causes shin splints when I walk. Arch support non existent.
"adidas Bought for my husband, as he's had this shoe in the past but said this time they ran a little small."
adidas Very speedy delivery. For very comfortable and amazing kicks
adidas Great product. Great value.
adidas Good
"adidas At first was worried about fit, but as I tried it on it was amazingly great snug fit. Needed a great price shoes for working out and these shoes will do the job since it is a flat shoe that will work great for it."
"adidas The shoes are very comfortable, at first like any shoe, tight until you stretch them into the contour of your foot. Very agile and good for a multitude of sports. i would recommend to all to have a pair of Sambas. Not a single con that i can find."
adidas good shoes
adidas These are the sexiest shoes I've ever purchased
"adidas Timely service, a great price, awesome experience."
adidas Best shoes
adidas Arrived when advertised in condition advertised and fit just right.
adidas Fast delivery and great price!!!!!!
adidas I use these shoes to coach in they are perfect
adidas I get this model of shoe for kung fu class. These shoes are pretty much perfect for that job.
"adidas So i figured I would try on these things. And boy have I been doing it WRONG my whole life.<br/><br/>If you don't know what shoes are man you are in for a treat! They are these things that you put on your feet to protect them! Crazy right? That's what I thought, witchcraft this must be. But no! There is no magic(or so I have yet to spot, however witches are crafty so I will update as soon as I find out more). This is an amazing product, all you do is put it on your feet (make sure the correct foot or else it can be uncomfortable) and your feet are protected from the following: Rocks, gum, hypodermic needles, vomit, spit, dog poo, water, broken glass, dry pokey grass, mud, pesky bums sleeping on the ground, and so much more! However they still don't protect you from the following: Bullets, mines, stab wounds, and std's, and a few other things so just be careful.<br/><br/>I know what you must be thinking, ""You put these on your feet? But that's what my feet are for! They already do the job, why bog them down""? That's what I thought, but you know the saying, ""Once you wear shoes, you won't even think about cereal again"". Just give it a try I mean the world is changing, change with it.<br/><br/>I know I am glad that I did."
adidas Nice looking shoes with the classic adidas stripes. It plays the role of both casual and sporty foot wear. I like it on account of the flexibility of blending it with any wardrobe.
"adidas Right size, just an awesome shoe! Thanks!"
adidas I purchased a pair of Adidas Sambas for a change from all those typical sneakers I had owned before.  It is indeed a great shoe; it has a nice look to it and is quite comfortable.  Anyone looking for an athletic soccer-type shoe who would just like to wear it casually will be impressed.
adidas very good
adidas Wear 12 in Adidas boost but these were too small for my feet. Would order up 1/2 size.
adidas Nice shoes
adidas great shoes i love it

adidas Great shoe! Still a classic
adidas Love it üëçüèºüëçüèº
adidas Very comfortable. Kinda hard to match something with it but the shoes themselves are cool.
"adidas Size 8 isn't always size 8. At the adidas stores near my house, size 8 is just right, and size 8.5 is a bit loose. However, size 8 here is a bit tight. I wonder what's the difference. Anyway, I hope the shoes will expand overtime. Love this style"
"adidas not real high arch support, just minor arch support, but not flat."
"adidas My order was everything I hoped it would be. And was uneventful, which was a good thing."
"adidas love em, except the tongue is too high, otherwise great"
adidas I love these shoes. They're really comfortable and last for a really long time! Almost have had them for a year and a half and they're still great!
adidas These are my son's favorite shoes and he only wears the white!
adidas Great - as expected
adidas dope
adidas Great
adidas good
adidas Tongues on these shoes are huge.  Not really a big deal but slightly annoying when putting them on and they would look a little funny if you're wearing shorts.
"adidas Shoes Came Quick. Great Condition. I Was Excited To Give These To My Dad. He Loves These Shoes. Unfortunately, I Got The Wrong Size And Color. My Bad."
adidas These are nice and my husband really liked them but the tongue is obnoxiously long!
adidas Found my new everyday shoe. Looks nice and great for soccer.

adidas Good

adidas They fit great and are awesome.
"adidas Excellent product, very pleased with my purchase, I recommend them to everyone. thank you very much"
adidas the front part and laces get dirty fast
adidas My son loves them.  They are his favorite every day shoe.
"adidas I purchased these for my 15 year old for Christmas, he is very rough on shoes but so far the shoes are standing up well.  The black is a bit more 2 toned than the picture seems to show so the leather on the shoe is more of a dark brown than a black."
adidas Great shoes and fast delivery!
adidas My husband wears these all the time.  Comfortable and perfect fit.
adidas Could be a little wider IMO
adidas Decent shoe... narrow though. took me a week or two to break em in. They also just seem flimsy. The inside of the heel broke down real quick.
"adidas Love these shoes. These are my 5th pair - been wearing them for the past 10 years. They are stylish, comfortable, and I also use them as my indoor soccer shoes."
"adidas I gave these a shot, even though I don't play soccer, because they were on sale and I liked the look. That's the perspective that I'll be reviewing them from.<br/><br/>These are not the ""fashion sneaker"" version; they have the ribbed tongue and arch support of an athletic shoe. This isn't really problem in my opinion, but it is worth noting if you planned on appropriating the athletic look without wearing actual athletic clothing. They fit me true to size. They're relatively warm and waterproof for those in cooler and wetter climates. That said, they still don't fill the role of a proper winter boot or rain boot.<br/><br/>Wear them with monochrome shaded clothes and you'll have a casual and sporty look. And, if you actually play sports, I assume it might even be practical as well."
adidas I NEED TO CHANGE THE SIZE
adidas This is my fourth pair of Sambas. I wear them 80% of the time and they last about a year for me. Great shoes.
"adidas I normally wear a size 11 shoe, but these 11's were to small. I think a 11.5 or 12 will do."
adidas Best shoes on the planet.
adidas Forever classic on the terrace.  Always have a pair or two around the house.
adidas Very stylish. Love this shoe. It's quite popular in the Mexican American ska/reggae scene in Los Angeles.
adidas Arived a few days later than scheduled but they were worth the wait!
adidas Thanks
adidas Love these shoes! Best shoe to play indoor soccer with!
"adidas I went with sure shot style on this one. I think I got these because of my obsession with the Beastie boys. These look good with all my clothes and maybe I got what all the kids are talking about, swagg. ha right...but not really."
adidas Great.
adidas My daughter love these shoes! She's in them all the time.
adidas Great price. Fits as expected

adidas Classic style and comfort
adidas A tad big but can live with
"adidas This was an very narrow sneaker. VERY. Maybe good for kids or adults with very skinny feet. Too bad, I loved the look and style."
"adidas I've been getting sambas for a decade now.  Good price, arrived in a couple days, no complaints."
"adidas But they're good for just walking around...my feet totally hurt when trying to use them for workouts as they provide no arch support. They are however, great for riding a bicycle."
"adidas I've worn these to play indoor soccer and to do things around town.  They provide a great, consistent kick in soccer, and they're super comfy just to wear around the house or town."

adidas very good and do some samba dance with them in football play ground
adidas 2nd time I own sambas no regrets I love them
"adidas I've always prefered Adidas over Nike. Adidas holds up better. This is practically the only Adidas shoe i'll wear. I need flat shoes because i don't really have an arch, so normally i buy Converse. These are good for Soccer. I use to wear them back in the days. Other than soccer or sports, they're good for playing drums."
"adidas Great shoes, look like a soccer hooligan, but if you have wide feet go with the shell toes"
"adidas Excellent purchase, excellent shoes, fit like a pair of gloves and they look good too.<br/>Adidas are the best brand"
adidas I got these for my boyfriend. Then he fell in love with me. The end.
"adidas I bought this for 2 of my big boys, and they both liked it.  They seem to have held up well and lasted about 4 months for both of them.  I would recommend them."
adidas Ok
"adidas These are by far my favorite shoes to wear. Not only are they comfy and supportive, I'm always ready in case a pickup soccer game comes up."
"adidas The classic indoor shoe, it's been around for so long for a reason."

adidas they were perfect.
"adidas Just bought my third pair.  These shoes fit well, feel good, and don't wear out."
"adidas These are the second pair I have owned.  They are a great everyday shoe, not just for soccer.  I have found that they are a little narrow in width, other than that, no issues."
adidas very good
"adidas Nice shoe, pretty common good for the price.<br/><br/>However, the rubber sole is pretty big and heavy. Not very good for running."

adidas Confidently bought it as a gift for my nephew.  Fits perfect and looks great !!!  More than happy with my purchase.
adidas Classic shoe that goes from the street to turf.  Fits well
"adidas Sadly, I was completely disappointed once I wore these shoes. Owning Samba's prior, I was expecting that same great fit and experience, definitely not the case. After an hour of wearing them, I took the shoes off and could not bare it any longer. At first I thought it was a fine fit but that ended quickly. Two stars for because the shoes came quickly and in great packaging, but sadly I wont be purchasing these again unless in person at a shoe store. Bummer since I have loved Samba's FOREVER!"
"adidas ESTE ES MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO"
adidas Classic shoe and fit as expected.... haven't noticed any compromise in materials compared to ones I've worn over the last 20 years!
adidas The Classic. I always have to have a fresh pair of these.
adidas Wore them as a kid and still wear them now... never had a bad pair! Plus they are so quiet... keep scaring my co-workers accidentally...
adidas Year after year I buy these shoes for my son when he outgrows his old pair.  He has a slender foot and they fit him great and give him good support.
"adidas Great value, delivered swiftly"
adidas re-ordered larger size it as my mistake.
adidas Very nice shoe...thanks.
adidas Great shoes for on the go and well as lounging around. Comfortable and fit just right. Came fast and was package securely.

"adidas Have loved these since I was a kid, no change to that now that I'm old. Sambas are great."
adidas kind of a flat sole
"adidas Everything went well, thanks"
"adidas Couple things as warning to people buying this.<br/><br/>1. This is a indoor soccer shoe, not a shoe for everyday wear. It is meant to be used to play soccer, not to kick around school or the mall.<br/><br/>2. Order at least a half size big. I Wish I had gone a full size bigger. I have worn size 12 shoes since 1997 and this is the first shoe that my toes touch the end, before i put weight on my foot.<br/><br/>3. They are very uncomfortable. Especially if you have a low arch or flat feet. They will likely be excruciating to wear. A tip: take out the insole and replace with another insole. I went with a standard gel insert and it made a world of difference.<br/><br/>TL;DR  Indoor Soccer shoe, Buy Oversize, Switch Insole<br/><br/>I still give it 4 stars because they are good shoes, and I get a lot of credibility from my students who want to talk to me about playing soccer etc. however, if i had known I probably would have gotten a pair meant for daily wear."
adidas Fit good classic sneaker
adidas Exactly like they were 20 years ago.  Made to last
adidas very very goodÔºÅ~~
adidas good
"adidas I have very wider feet and sometimes have problems fitting into certain shoes. I was very excited to receive the shoes, they have always been a classic shoe.<br/>When I first put the shoes on I notice that they were a little snug but thought they would stretch out some. After wearing the shoes for a couple of hours to break them in they had not stretched out at all. I tried the water in the bag and freezing them overnight trick which normally works but it did not.<br/>Very unfortunate because  like I said I like the style and they are great casual shoes.<br/><br/>Note:I was given this product at a discount for my unbiased review."
adidas My so loves his Sambas. He used to wear them as a teenager. Fit is great.
adidas They are a bit tight.  But that has always been the nature of this shoe type.

"adidas These shoes are great.  Wish I could find them cheaper, but price is always around $65.00.  The shoes have lasted me over 2 years with casual use. I don't use them to play indoor."
"adidas My son loves wearing the Adidas Samba shoe. He had a pair that he wore out. When I saw it available on Amazon, I bought him a replacement pair. He is very satisfied."
"adidas Is his second pair, durable, comfortable....GREAT STYLE !!"
adidas Good fit and just like the Samba's I remember
"asics I have plantar fasciitis and I originally bought the gel venture 4's which were great. So I figured I'd get the 5's. As soon as I put the 5's on I remembered why I bought this shoe in the 4 model. It's very cushiony throughout, has a nice cushy deep heel cup, and has nice arch supports. All things I need in a shoe. I am going to say that I can walk all day in these shoes as I could and still can in the 4's which are 2 years old at this point. All in all for 40 bucks you can not beat this shoe. I can't believe I waited 2 years to buy new shoes especially with plantar fasciitis."
"asics The toe portion of the shoe is already coming off. Not just on one, but both. I expected better from Asics."
"asics I do need to qualify this review, as I had no intention of using this as a running shoe.  It was purchased for its looks and availability in 4E width.  The price is less than half of what normally put out for pounding the pavement.<br/><br/>First, it is a nice walking or casual shoe.  For under $40, it is well constructed, and I really like the understated look of the shoes.  After some use, it is very comfortable for standing or walking.  I even has pulling loops behind the heel, which I though had disappeared from these shoes in the name of economy.<br/><br/>Running in these shoes isn't recommended, in my opinion.  Most running shoes in wide or extra wide widths typically have a lot of support, because there is usually a parallel assumption that the user is relatively heavy.  This show provides only a medium level support and cushioning.  Two other items will not make running in these shoes a bargain.  The area over the big toe is not reinforced and will wear out prematurely for runners.  I know this from experience with two pairs of ASICS GT-2170, which were great running shoes otherwise.  ASICS knows this is an issue; more recent shoes such as their GT-1000 are reinforced in that area.  Finally, my ankles have no clearance to the top edge of this shoe and contacts it when running (but not walking).  This is an issue, and maybe why the shoes are sold at a steep discount.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a well made casual shoes (5 stars), but unless you're running distance races in Chuck Taylor All Stars, this isn't a great option (3 stars) for running."
"asics First: These are absolutely trail shoes above all else. If you do a lot of street running, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Second: Fantastic shoe. I could not believe the quality for the money I paid for them. Top notch.<br/><br/>I run a 10k on the road every day, and after reading numerous reviews on this site and others surrounding these shoes and numerous people who use them for road running, I decided to bite. I am on a budget, and this is a hard time of year to find street shoes for less than a hundred bucks. After coming from a light weight street running shoe, I absolutely cannot recommend these for street running. I know they are a trail running or ""multi surface running shoe"", but after seeing the sheer volume of users who take to the black top with them I decided to bite.<br/><br/>So, why don't I like them for street running, you may ask? Primarily, weight. These are bulky, at least twice the weight of my previous shoe, and the break in period was quite painful for the first week.<br/><br/>I took my dogs to some very steep local trails recently (I live near the very hilly finger lakes region of New York) and these shoes are PHENOMENAL trail shoes. I was running top speed through a very narrow, tree, rock, and root ridden trail that curved this way and that with almost every step and felt unstoppable. The grip felt like I had cleats on. Despite the speed, I could turn on a dime, using trees to propel my momentum through the curves, and not feeling a thing beneath my feet despite the various terrain types I was covering (from rocky to slipper needle covered loose dirt).<br/><br/>I knocked a star for personal reasons, and really, it's a reason that the shoe wasn't exactly designed for, so I'm not really sure if it's even fair for me to do so. I only did this as many other reported a great road running experience, and I feel they came up short in that regard.<br/><br/>As far as trail running goes: are their better shoes out there? Yes. Are you going to find them for anywhere near this price? Absolutely not. If you're on a budget, and run trails, these are your shoe.<br/><br/>And lastly, as I forgot to mention above, the fit was perfect."
"asics I buy a lot of ASICS shoes because 1) I know what size I wear, 2) the price is right, 3) selection is good, and 4) they're comfortable. But I only use them for casual wear....I don't run in them. I bought this particular model because of the muted, earth-tone colors that looked much better with casual slacks than the neon style of most running shoes. While the previous models I've purchased have been comfortable, they were very lightly constructed, lacking much stability or cushioning. And they weren't durable, with my toe rubbing through the top surface within a couple of months.<br/><br/>These are different. I've had them about five months now and my toe hasn't yet frayed the upper mesh. Plus, the stability and cushioning seem more substantial and my feet don't hurt during the day. Love the shoes."
"asics I needed outdoor running shoes for Summer volleyball.  I am glad I found these Asics shoes in my size.  And the best thing was they were on sale here at Amazon. The shoes offer great support and traction which reduces slipping while playing on grass. The shoes are also comfortable.  I added new insoles to increase the comfort which will help with trail walking, running or hiking. I have tried and purchased many pairs of running shoes (Nike, Addidas, Saucony, newbalance, Fila) over the past 10 years and recently started to looking at Asics.  I am glad I was able find and purchase 6 pairs of Asics running shoes and running socks this year alone.  Once you find the right pair of shoes and socks that fit you can't help but order more.  Great product, service and quality!"
"asics These are awesome.  Sneakers are very much a 'your mileage may vary' item, but even with that I think most people would be happy with these.  I will say that I bought these and with virtually no wearing at all, gave them the 'Disney' test.  For those unaware, that means I spent a week in Orlando, at several parks, in the blazing heat, on my feet most of the day.  For any shoe, that's a lot to ask, but especially for a shoe that was only worn in the house for about half an hour prior to that!  The shoe performed amazingly; fit was great, I got no undue wear or hot spots on my feet from them, in fact on most days I was unaware that I had shoes on, which is saying something after 12+ hours at Magic Kingdom!  I never felt like my feet were hot in them either, and it was 90 degrees and above the week we were there.<br/><br/>In full disclosure, while I did do a lot of walking in them, I have not run in them.  But I also didn't buy them for that."
"asics Had the shoe for about a month soo... Shoe is decent, I would think it would give more support for long days at work on your feet. I know its on concrete floor but still I expect a outdoor walking/running shoe to help with comfort.  I wear a 11.5 D and got it in the same size I wear, and took a chance to not get the side since 4E would be too big. The standard shoe has enough room to adjust.  Just one small issue, recently I noticed my right foot on the heel it started to rub and cause pain where every time I took a step it would hurt. Now its like a blister and I don't know what caused it, but every other shoe I own hasn't done this. Just something to look out for."
"asics So far the only shoes I've found that are comfortable on my large and wide feet (with narrow ankles).<br/><br/>I wear them for working out, walking, and everyday usage. They are good in summer and winter too. Normally I have to go with extra-wide, but with these shoes the normal widths (D) are comfortable ‚Äì you've just got to wear them a day or two to break them in and then they are GREAT.<br/><br/>That's my experience, but I guess everybody's feet are different. Not everybody has wide, hard-to-please feet like mine."
"asics I'm normally a Payless BOGO shopper but decided to spend a bit more and hopefully get a better quality shoe. These are excellent well worth the money which still isn't that much compared to what other prices are. Super comfortable great super, great non slip and gripping soles for hiking. You feel really secure on dirt paths with lose rocks and climbing over boulders. My calf's felt like they got a workout just from my feet being supported and the shape of the soles. Great for daily wear and definitely a great hiking shoe. They are breathable. And you don't need thick socks to be comfortable."
"asics As always with Asics, the pair fit perfectly!  As a walking shoe, these provide exceptional support surrounding the entire foot.  Unlike other shoes which have cushioning at only the sole, these ""surround"" the foot in support and comfort.  I recently purchased two pairs of a low-end shoe at a box store.......two weeks later, threw them out!  My feet felt ""flat,"" for lack of a better term; there was practically  zero support.  Will purchase again and would recommend."
"asics These are excellent shoes. Have been buying Asics repeatedly and have never been disappointed. They are consistently good quality.<br/><br/>I worked on my feet for years, both standing and walking. My feet hurt so bad I got in trouble for sitting while working at my computer, and I cried after I was required to stop doing that. My secret for comfortable feet: Buy shoes that are longer and wider than my actual shoe size. The last time I was fitted for shoes, I was 10 and 1/2 D. Now I buy Asics 14 4E. They don't flop around on my feet like you might think, and they are perfectly comfortable. Shop around on Amazon for good prices on a good product!"
"asics These are pretty great trail running shoes. They are thick but flexible, light yet durable, and most of all very comfortable. I thought saving money might decrease the quality of Asus shoes, but these are still better then most other brands at the same price.<br/>I went from an old pair of ua spine shoes to these, and I was really unsure because I loved how flexible and light my shoes were at the moment. These have the same flexibility, but they are much more heavy duty. They are just a bit heavier then my previous pair, but you don't notice it much after a mile."
"asics These are great shoes! My kids love them. They are supportive, yet flexible and supportive.  I bought two pair, one for each of my sons, and they've practically lived in the shoes since they arrived.  I purchased them in a larger size, of course, and a different color than their last pair, but  these are identical to the shoes they wore previously.  We looked around for better shoes, or a better bargain, but wound up once again with these. It was a good decision."
"asics I was disappointed with the roughness of the shoe comfort level. It felt too stiff, and one left side felt tighter than the right shoe. After running, and breaking them in; I appreciated the stiffness the shoe provided. To me, it felt like it gave your foot more protection from twisting your ankle when traversing the field, or concrete when running. It broke in and became more comfortable.  So far, a very well made shoe. It just takes time to break in."
"asics Not as comfortable, or as ""breathable"" as other shoes I've had in the past. My feet are sweating pretty bad after less than an hour of wearing."
asics great fit and comfortable right outta the box. didn't get the new shoe pain when your foot is adjusting to the shoe.its also light and keeps my feet from tingling by the end of day. on concrete all day bought a second pair just to have another when they stop making style
"asics So far so good.  I have had them for about a week.  I ordered size 10 the size I usually wear for most shoes.  They fit great.  They seem durable and are very comfortable.  I have run in them several times and they feel great.  I will say they felt a little stiff when they came in but I just wore them for a day or so and they broke in well.  I would purchase these again assuming they stand the test of time, which has yet to be seen."
"asics I have put these shoes through the ringer over the past few months, and they have done the job. Taking them walking, camping, mountain biking (they got filthy), and other outdoor event. The comfort was more then I expected. Had heard good reviews on Asics and now I understand why. For the price you pay you get a hell of a shoe. Many hours on the feet and not once have I experienced an ache or pain. Even though they are walking shoes, I use them for other outdoor activities and they continue to impress me."
"asics Best shoes I've ever run in honestly. Active duty calls for a decent amount of running and with other shoes I would get shin pains, with these it is minimized an extreme amount and what I find amazing. Is how light yet nicely padded these are. They fit well on my feet and I ordered them in a half size lower than my nikes but if you want advice go to a store and try on 3 or so different pairs and then make your decision on here."
"asics These shoes are narrower than my other ASICS, but for me that is a good thing as I have a narrow foot, but if you were expecting the shoes o be as wide as the other models you could be disapointed. Overall I like the ASICS shoes , this is my fifth pair."
"asics My son just returned from Pico Duarte, the highest peak in the Dominican Republic and all Caribbean Islands. The challenge involves different kinds of terrains, plus the unpredictable tropical weather, with temperatures raging between 2 to 0 Celsium degrees (26 degrees in daytime when arriving at the starting point in La Ci√©naga town, and 0 degrees at the top of Pico Duarte), Wind,sun, cold, rain, lots and lots of mud, rocky paths slippery with mud and rain, and the beautiful tropical forest everywhere... Going up, then down, all day long. He walked about 60 kilometers, distributed more or less evenly in three days.<br/><br/>All that said, now what you need to know is that my son absolutely loves his shoes! He told me they are very light, dried quickly, and were comfortable.He also told me that he is still wondering how these shoes got though all what he did to them, and came out of this rough test almost perfect! (the rubber at a little part of the tip of one shoe will need a bit of glue to be good as new). At one point, when coming down from one of the many mountains, there was a lot of mud in the rocky path. He was more or less ¬®skating¬® downwards, because he was tired and he just didn't care what happened to the shoes, as long as he got to the bottom (where the camp was) soon. Afterwards, when washing the mud away, he was surprised to see no damage was done to the shoes!<br/><br/>It was raining almost all the time, so he just put his shoes near the fire they built every night, and in no time the shoes were dry again. He had another pair of shoes, just in case, but didn't use them because they were not as comfortable and light as his new shoes.<br/><br/>He also told me that he noticed the shoes somehow repelled the huge amounts of mud they were supposed to be caked in. When the shoes were too full of mud inside and everywhere, he just took them in the river and washed away the excess. He was so glad to have these excellent shoes for this trip. Many of his friends had heavier shoes, tenis or boots, and not as comfortable, and they had blisters from day 1. My son told me that he got through the hardest parts of the trip, and had not even one blister (he was using one number up from his normal size, but the strain of the rough paths were enough  to damage shoes and feet alike, and my son got away from that with his feet intact!)."
asics Very happy with these running shoes; although I do not run; I walk. The first time I had a chance to use them I went on a 6 mile walk. I walk mostly on sidewalks and pavement with the exception of a one mile trail around the lake. It has performed very well on these surfaces. I have had no blisters or other problems. The shoes were very comfortable. I cannot think of any cons to speak of. I would recommend these shoes to those who walk.
"asics Bought the wide size.  Extremely comfortable.  Fit same as my other ASICS running shoe. Good support.  Insole comes out so you can wash, or use different inserts.  I have an orthotic insert under mine.  Will be buying another pair for backups."
"asics I put a lot of miles on my running shoes and typically use them until they're too beat up to take another step. I have been using this pair since I received them on October 20th, so they are still pretty new. I run about 5 miles a week. I find this pair to be quite supportive, which I like, but they have little cushioning. I can feel a good amount of impact with each step. Typically when I try on shoes in the store, I opt for the pair that feels like I'm running on clouds. Aside from that, they breathe and are pretty lightweight, but most importantly - they fit well. These are good for forefoot running.<br/><br/>I will continue to buy from Asics, but in the future I will go to the store instead of ordering online. I like to know exactly what I'm getting, and that is not easily done when ordering online."
asics Decent 40 dollarish shoe from a brand I've learned has a longer lifespan than most of it's competition.  The ones they replaced were over ten years old.  The difference now is in build quality but I can't complain because this Asic's predecessor was over 5 years old.  Definitely a casual walking the dog type shoe.  Not really form fitting enough for running. Your feet would shift around in them too much.
asics I just started running again recently. I used Nike Air's(received as a gift) and had a lot of pain in my leg. I could run a few miles with my ascis 2110's but not with Nike.Since they were well rated and expensive I though its probably because I put on some weight.<br/><br/>Finally I decided to get ascis again. Man I could feel the difference instantly. I ran 5.4 miles on day one with them and NO LEG PAIN the other day.<br/><br/>I would definately recommend these shoes to any one that needs Arch support.
"asics I bought these for my 16 year old son about 7 months ago to use for gym each day at school. They have pretty intense workout days that cover everything from running and boot camp style training, to days where they lift weights. These shoes have held up to a school year of use and abuse and have kept up with everything that's been thrown at them. They've been a great pair of workout shoes for him."
"asics Look, I was so excited to get these shoes. When I tried them on they were comfortable, fit great and I liked the look of them. After about 2 months of wearing them the rubber soles started to separate from the foam-ish cushioning. This does not occur on the inner part of the shoe. If you look you will see that the rubber is molded and glued up over the sides of the foam cushioning on the inner part of the shoe unlike the outer side where the rubber is only adhered flat on the bottom. Anyone who plays any kind of sports what-so-ever will wear these shoes out in a week or two. I run with other asics shoes but used these for disc golf and casual walking. These shoes were the most disappointing purchase for me because I love to brag about how great asics shoes are. These were of very, very poor quality and I am blown away by all the positive reviews on here, I am truly blown away. Don't buy these shoes unless you plan to only walk on carpet floors. If you are then great, they'll make great house shoes. Hopefully someone reads this and doesn't waste their money."
"asics I've been wearing ASICS for over 20 years and always loved them and I had never had any problems with them until this pair. The left shoe fits like a glove, as has every other pair of ASICS I ever owned but the right shoe felt different from the first time I put it on. Something about the back of the shoe just has never felt right and it developed a hole the size of a dime within the first two weeks of very casual wear. The shoes still looks new on the outside but the rub on my heel from the hole makes me not want to wear them anymore. I may give ASICS another try but this pair has been a big disappointment."
asics 5 Stars after wearing them for two days. The fit is so comfortable. Then again I did listen to some reviewers and bought one size larger and got one size larger for my feet. I think I could have stayed with my normal size of 10.5 and would have fit fine.  For long distance running it would be ok to buy one size larger.  I think they are a little heavy for marathons. The treads can be for trail walks and jogs.
"asics One of the shoes hurts my feet because the arch support is in the wrong place. I wore another pair of ASICS shoes while I worked and I did not wear these shoes for a couple of months. I didn't notice the problem until it was too late to ask for a return.<br/><br/>I work a new job where I am in contact with the public and I cannot wear my comfy old ASICS running shoes. Those shoes are the best pair of tennis shoes I've ever owned.<br/><br/>I have no feet problems and these are the only pair of shoes I've ever worn that hurt my foot like this. I have dress shoes, boots, and other tennis shoes, and the only time my foot hurts is when I wear this pair. That leads me to believe that it is specific to this pair of shoes.<br/><br/>Next time I will spend $150 on another pair of ASICS because it seems like you really do get what you pay for with these shoes. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my other pair!"
"asics The only sneaker in 4E that gives enough space to accommodate a large bulky orthotic insert and still have enough space left to feel comfortable. The price is fair, I refuse to pay $150 for a pair of shoes that will be used up and tossed 6 months after buying.<br/><br/>Super comfortable, the only shoes for fussy feet. They last just as long as other brands that cost 3X as much."
"asics So far I'm loving these shoes.  The size is exactly as I expected. They are very comfortable.<br/><br/>It's taking some getting used to because my previous sneakers were so bad that I have a sharp pain on the ball of my foot.  These shoes don't magically remove the pain, but they are helping the pain slowly fade away the more I wear these and stop using the old shoes.<br/><br/>I haven't run in them yet, but I'm considering a second pair in a different color to use exclusively for running."
"asics Made well. Do not have any of the problems that others have posted with low ratings with stitching, glue and fabric matching.<br/>Fits a bit large. Find my foot slipping inside despite how tight I tie my laces.<br/>Can't return or exchange it was bought on a lightening purchase.<br/>Lesson learned. Despite the convenience of Amazon, always try your clothes on in the store first."
"asics These are among the best trail running shoes I've ever used, and have a very traditional footprint with plenty of traction- but still very road-friendly for those who run on both surfaces,The 4E width has a roomy toe box, great stability for technical trail running, yet not a minimalist construction or zero-drop shoe which seems to be in vogue these days. I bought ten pair for $45 each and that's at least $20 off of retail price. The shoe accommodates custom full-length orthotics, including keeping the original shoe insert which offers additional shock absorption. It has a rugged toe stop for rocks, tree roots, etc, and a very straight last. There are many other great features to the shoe I could list, but trust me, as long as shoe weight is not an issue (they are not lightweight but still reasonable), I would buy as many pair as you can before the model is discontinued and you are scrambling for a replacement. They are also terrific just for everyday walking, so I basically live in these shoes. Bravo Asics!"
"asics This is purchase number two of this same shoe. My husband works for FedEx and runs from 7am to 5pm on his route. He wore these every day for 6 months. His feet started hurting because they were totally shot. Got him this new pair and he is right back to normal. They are durable, comfortable, and we love that they come in 4E width. We will likely by them again in another 6 months."
asics A terrific buy for an affordable price. I wear these every day when I'm not working. They are incredibly comfy and they hold up well against trails both concrete and dirt whilst running or walking. They fit like a dream. It's not about the years you'll get out of these shoes but the mileage. Believe me when I say you'll get a lot of miles out of these shoes. Asics does shoes right.
"asics Fits fine.  I bought these to replace a pair that wore our prematurely in the heel.  I have a narrow heel and tend to wear out shoes in the mid-heel due to slippage.  I wear thick wool socks and still have this problem.  These shoes allow lacing to help more than most, but ultimately they still fail at the heel for me.  Other brands much worse, so I bought another pair.  Nice color scheme that doesn't shout."
"asics I wore these today for the first time. They are great. Through mud, stones, underbrush and cow paddies. The sizing was perfect. I went from a pair of Nikes to these. The Nikes were size 9. My feet have grown and the Nikes were definitely tight. Nothing to do with the Nikes. My feet grew. I'm a growing boy of 66. They told me that your feet, ears and nose never stop growing. Well, either way, I thought half size larger on the Asics. Perfect. If I had done another full size as some people suggest, I would have been able to use them for skiing. Which would have been a huge error. Also I bought some amazing socks that don't color match. But who cares? The socks are Yonovo. In the Quick Dry 5-pack. Incredible choice. I was floatin' in my Asics and Yonovos"
"asics I wear between a 10 - 10.5 US wide. I ordered the 10.5 wide US size and they fit perfectly. I have only had them about a week, and I've worn them everyday. So far they feel great, and give a lot of support for daily wear. They seem to be well constructed for the price. If these hold up after about a month, I think I will buy another pair in a different color just for options."
"asics So far these are great. I  love Asics. I have Plantar fascia and over pronate. Asics seem to be the only brand that I can wear all day and walk miles in with no foot pain. I have a pair of Gel Exalt that I love, but after only 3 months the inside heel lining has started to rip and come apart. I am hoping the Gel Venture will be more durable while still offering the same comfort."
"asics i have personally owned 6 pairs of these over the recent years.  I discovered that asics fit me perfectly so i have not moved away from the gel ventures snce then.  I like the ruggedness of them.  They are great for everyday use , but also good for hiking and trail use.  I currently have two.  one for everyday use, and one strictly for running and my gym bag. nice shoe and they hold up great"
"asics Super comfortable out of the box! Toe box width is perfect, heel counter grip is very good, not constricting in any way. I have a wider (3E/4E) foot and medium width or slightly narrow heel. Excellent fit!! Did the standard break in period of walking in them for a while, then did my trail runs... First time 40 min, no issues. Following weekend, Sat./Sun., 45 min each day. No soreness anywhere, except the usual from running two days in a row. I typically run 3 times a week, 45-60 min per run, during the summer. When it's cooler/cooler out, longer runs. Looking forward to more time on the trail! Excellent value and comfort. You will not be disappointed!"
"asics You cannot find better shoes on the market than Asics and this color combo has to be the hardest to find anywhere.  I had a pair of GT2000T and they lasted me 2 years until I finally ran one too many trails.  These shoes are NOT the GT2000 series but have a nice tread and are very comfortable.  People have had issues with the sole coming apart, I carry super glue with me in my car for this reason.  It's happened to me with ALL companies but I've had good luck with Asics in general and these are very very comfortable."
asics All my shoes are size 10.5. These were just too small. re-ordered 1/2 size larger. We'll see if they fit better when the new size arrives.<br/><br/>Update - 6-16-2017<br/>New shoes arrived today. Size 11 fit much better. Snug fit but that is expected with new shoes. I'm sure they will stretch a bit as I break them in. I would recommend buying these shoes 1/2 size larger than your regular size.
asics I've been buying Adidas cross trainers for a few years but thought I'd give these a try as I've had positive experiences in the past with Asics and these were being offered at a great price.  They fit perfectly (I'm a solid size 11) and were comfortable right out of the box.  I haven't worn them a lot but they seem well constructed.  I'd recommend giving these a shot!
"asics These ASICS Gel Venture shoes are very comfortable and are great for rugged terrain, or just outside use.  I would not say that they are for running though, although you certainly could, as they are not heavy.  This is a solid all purpose shoe and the visual design is appealing.  Based on this shoe, I would consider purchasing other shoe designs offered by this brand."
"asics These shoes are a surprising success for my feet! I have wide feet and have never shopped outside of NewBalance, this was a shoe for running or exercise. It turns out that I prefer these as my daily shoe, just be careful of how easily they stick to the ground. These shoes are grippy but as long as your walking/running you will be fine.<br/><br/>I got 10.5 4E and they fit great. One tip that I noticed when searching for these shoes is that the athletic types can be a bit narrow, but I did not experience that compared to most extra-wide shoes."
asics Perfect fit..Very comfortable..Cushion is excellent..only downside I would say is Shoe-laces..the material of shoe Lace is so smooth that it loosens up no matter how tightly you tie your shoe laces..in 2 miles run usually I have to tighten my shoelaces 4-5 times..because of that it is sometimes risky to run and also variable grips may damage the leg..so excellent product but need to improve this minor thing..
asics I order a 1/2 size larger since they didn't have the wide version. These are really comfortable and fit perfectly. I use them for hiking dirt paths as opposed to trail running since my knees don't like running anymore.  I found no problems after a couple of 6 mile hikes. Will update after an up coming trip to Chicago where I hope to get 20 miles a day walking in.
"asics These shoes were a bit too large, but that's not really my problem with them. I've never had gel for support and I'm not impressed. On the elliptical machine I felt the support give out in patches causing numbness. This happened in maybe 15 minutes of my workout. I changed to a treadmill and something about the fit caused enough abrasion on the inside of my foot to make a good sized blister. Could just be me, but I've not had anywhere as severe issues with any of my previous workout shoes."
asics I really love ASICS for running but the last several ones I have bought haven't lasted long and started to hurt my feet after several months.  I have an old pair that I love and can run half marathons without problems but the newer ones that I get don't work well with my feet.
"asics This is my husbands 6th pair of ASICS Gel, he really likes them.  He loves a comfortable shoe at a very reasonable price and he gets that with this shoe!  He does have to replace them about every 6 months, but keep in mind he wears them for everything!  He uses them on the elliptical, wears them during football practices with the JFL team and just for daily activities!"
"asics I have been of ASICS, but lately the newer styles aren't working for me. I was a huge fan of the Gel Pulse line. Those seemed made for my feet. The Gel Venture 5 has a smaller toe box and narrower fit. The arch support is less than the Gel Pulse as well. I do like these for traveling on airlines. I like the subdued color scheme, so I don't stand out in a crowd."
asics Bought these shoes and have worn them several times.  I walk 4 miles per day and I have been through a few different shoes.  Some were very poorly made.  Some had very little support.  All were very uncomfortable.  This all changed with these ASICs!  They have it all.  I couldn't be happier.  No blisters... no sore feet... no leg pains due to lack of foot support... I have finally found my perfect walking shoes!!!
"asics Bought these for trail walking and they are very comfortable, while providing great support. The outsole is better suited to rough roads/asphalt and light trails rather than truly rough trails or hiking so just keep that in mind. They dont have the deep grooves for getting a good grip in rougher conditions IMO. I ordered a size wider than normal as some reviews mentioned they ran small, but I did not find that to be the case. I could have ordered the 2E instead of the 4E and been just fine so I'd say they fit just as expected compared to my previous pair of Asics."
"asics I had to go up a size to fit my ankle brace following a foot injury and surgery. I also realized that I should have gone up a size sooner, since the other foot fits ok. I got these in 4E to accommodate the brace. I have an older pair of the same shoe in 13 that fits more like a 12. so, in general, I would say this shoe tends to fit smaller than usual."
asics Great fit. All my shoes are 8's and that's what I ordered. Fit great. Shoes look better than the pictures online. Wore them for 2 days so far. Comfortable no discomfort so far.
"asics Great shoes.  I love them.  I need a 4 wide and the Asics brand offers this width which fits perfectly.<br/><br/>In addition, the price is a really good and this means it a terrific value for a shoe of this quality.<br/><br/>I walk my dog 3-5 miles  everyday and I need a good pair of shoes.  These shoes required very little break in and are very comfortable.  You can't go wrong with this shoe."
asics I ordered these to replaced my Gel Venture 4 shoes which will now be my backups. I like this particular model as it gives me support and comfort while either on the treadmill or on the track and the price is reasonable. I purchased these in the Castle Rock/Black/Green color and already have had complements on how good they look by people in the gym.
"asics Good looking, nice fitting, lightweight and comfortable shoes that I purchased after reading excellent reviews both on and outside of Amazon.  I bought these to use primarily for our international traveling and wanted something that was both a good walking show and a good hiking shoe.  These shoes fit the bill and I'd easily put them in the ""best-bang-for-the-buck"" category!"
"asics I own a pair of Nike 2014 Air Max sneakers that cost around $150.<br/><br/>I tried the Asics on at a store with the Nike on one foot and the Asics on the other........I could not tell the difference, they felt EXACTLY the same.<br/><br/>For the price......you can not go wrong with these sneakers."
"asics Earlier I was using a pair of walking shoes (Go Walk 2 by Sketchers) for running. My right leg started aching, so my friend suggested I buy proper running shoes instead of using walking shoes. I didn't think the shoes was the problem behind my leg pain but I still bought these shoes just because they were recommended. And I am extremely happy to say that my leg pain has actually stopped just after 2 uses of these shoes. So, yeah, lesson learned. Running shoes for running and walking shoes for walking. Another corollary is that these shoes do their job, that is provide arch support, really well.<br/><br/>Other than that, they look pretty decent. I am slightly unhappy about the fit -- they fit somewhat small -- but that may be because my shoe size is little more than 7. But size 8 shoes get too big so I have to buy size 7, which end up fitting snugly though not uncomfortably. In other words, they are not the most comfortable pair out there but they do their job well so I'm happy."
"asics I got the extra wide size because the regular size is too narrow and the wide size was not available in my shoe size.  The shoe fits great length wise but since I had to get extra wide, it is somewhat big, but not too big that it is uncomfortable, and not too small and narrow like the regular size is so overall, I am satisfied with the shoe."
asics Great price! Great show I got a pair for my Hubby who is on his feet working over 10 hour days on average &amp; his employee who works along side of him then got my dad a pair who also works physically all day. They all three love them! Comfortable light weight rested feet!!  Amazing price for product. I order my Husband a new pair once he wears his out.
"asics I pulled these straight out of the box and put a 2 mile walk on them the day they arrived.  The fit was perfect and they are very comfortable just like my other Asics.  I have walked a few more times (2 miles each time) and I still love them.  I try to walk daily and I need a good comfortable shoe that is durable.  So far, they fit the need perfectly."
"asics I love these shoes. I bought a second pair on amazon after picking them out at a local retailer, the fit was identical. The price was a bit better on Amazon. ASICS are the brand I prefer, and I always try shoes on in person before I buy them online.<br/><br/>They are very light and have the arch support I need for my low-arched feet. My arches have not complained after 2 months of training. I run on sand and pavement for 5k 3-4 times a week.<br/><br/>The color I bought blue/orange has a nice contrast but is not too loud. I will update them after a few more months. My old pair is 2 months old without significant wear."
"asics Even though I ordered my correct size and width, the shoes were a bit narrow.  The sole is comfortable, however, I did have to stretch the shoes so they would fit properly... Additional research by talking with athletes and sales people at local shoe stores, they all have said that ASICS brand tend to run narrow so go up one size in width."
"asics This is my second time getting this shoe.  They are not the lightest running shoe on the market, but I really like the support that they offer.  I generally have pretty prominent knee pain when running long distance and these shoes have really helped alleviate that concern.  I also used them to backpack 70+ miles in Zion National Park this summer.  I didn't want to use hiking boots because I didn't want a bulky shoe.  These held up phenomenally.  They offered the necessary support and traction but I felt the flexibility for my feet.  Additionally the shoes aired out so well I didn't get any blisters, whereas my girlfriend who had bought top of the line boots struggled with blisters from day 2 of our trip."
"asics Can't beat it for the money.  4 stars only because the Nimbus is a 5 star shoe in my experience, and this is definitely not a Nimbus.  That said, if you're looking for something with a bit more structure, but that remains friendly to underpronation (especially if you don't mind a bit less cushioning), this is probably the best value out there."
"asics I bought these for my husband and he loves them. He needed a replacement for his old pair and these fit the bill. The color is just as you see on the pictures and is very subtle. They have good traction, good sole support and they're super comfortable. He loves that the style breathes so he doesn't feel his feet getting uncomfortable."
"asics My husband used to always wear 12's in shoes, but I showed him how sometimes 11.5 would fit if it was wide enough. I ordered these in 11.5 4E and they fit him very well. He's not picky about shoes, as long as they breathe well and are not brightly colored so he can wear them to the office. So far these have been working great for him."
"asics Superb. No two ways about it. Just took them out of the box. Wore them and within 5 minutes the ""New Shoe"" tightness went away. Went about my work wearing them and completely forgot that I was wearing them!! So light, and comfortable. Have been an asics fan for quite some time, and it has only become more after this purchase!"
"asics You should never have to ""break in"" shoes just because you have wide feet. I have a very hard time finding shoes that fit like they should, and many brands are very thin even when labeling a shoe as wide or extra-wide. Mine fit exactly as labeled, straight out of the box. They also seem very well built. I use mine strictly for the gym, but I wouldn't hesitate to use them outdoors regularly either. This is my second pair of Asics; my last pair gave me two good years of service and have been retired to outdoor use. I'm sold."
"asics These shoes look great and so far have helt up very well.  One ""issue"" I have is that the soles are super thin.  I have plantar fasciitis and was expecting a little more support.  I had a pair of newbalance orthotic supports that I have put in these shoes that work very well.  The other issue is that they don't grip at all on wet surfaces.  Sometimes it feels like I'm on ice when the concrete is wet."
asics I actually wear an 11 2E  but ordered the 12 4E because I want to wear cushioned socks.  I found that the larger size was a perfect fit so<br/>it runs small and narrower than expected.  I will just have to remember to order<br/>a size larger when and if I order again.  Other than that the shoe is comfortable and easy to walk in.
asics The Asics 11.5 4E size has been a real plus for me.  I have a wide foot that tends to rub too much in medium (D) width shoes.  The only question I have about the Gel Venture 5 is whether it's going to hold up like the GEL Contend 3 that I have been using thus far.  It is already showing some wear in the shoe lining in the heel area.
"asics I use these as my go to gym shoes now, and I love them. For years I had been wearing nothing but Nike cross trainers at 3x the price because nothing else felt comparable.<br/><br/>Not only do these fit like the Nikes, they also offer enough support for my plantar fasciitis that I can walk most of the day without too much pain."
asics I have been buying Asics runnings shoes for approximately 12 years now and find that sizing across different models is very consistent.  I wear a 10.5 and they always fit the same which is greatly appreciated when ordered online.  Shoes look great and have a medium to high arch in them which works perfectly for my foot.  My last pair of Asics lasted 2 years of daily use at work as a nurse.  I expect the same to come from these.
asics This is the second pair I have owned and they are great. The first pair I bought for golf and softball due to the more aggressive tread. They have held up great considering the punishment they have taken.  This pair I bought for day to day wear since I liked my first pair so much. Good cushioning and great arch support and the 4E are plenty wide even for my foot. I'm a large person and can tell you that they maintain their cushioning better and longer than any other shoe I have ever owned.
"asics Great trail running shoe that hits many pluses for a travel option:  non-slip soles for hiking trails, subtle color for street-ware with khaki or travel trousers, light-weight, sporty Asics design &amp; outstanding reviews by purchasers on many websites.  The major minus for me is that the shoe length, width &amp; toe-box height constrain my foot.  I had to return the shoe in two lengths because the length, width &amp; toe room were too small.  The 4E (shoe width) I tried at another vendor was VERY wide-- too wide."
asics We saw this shoes at a store and my husband loved them.<br/>Unfortunately they didn't have his size. We looked in couple more stores and we couldn't find the same model.<br/>So we search online and found and bought them.<br/>We got them a week later but they were just perfect.<br/>The box was inside another box and everything looked great!
"asics My experience with this shoe is limited to two days I tried to make it work. It didn't work out. The sneakers are way too small very narrow with steeply cut toe box. The size I ordered is my standard size and this is the first time ever I have return shoes purchased online. The shoe also felt poorly padded and flimsy, but I could probably live with that if not for impossibly wrong sizing."
asics The ASIC'S Men's Gel Venture 5 is extremely comfortable and very light weight. I find that after a full day making deliveries in and out of a pickup<br/>that my feel still are happy at the end of the day and I don't have the feeling that I just have to remove them when I get home. Thanks to nurse Kim for the recommendation
"asics I'm a big guy, 6'5"" 280lbs, that is susceptible to plantar fasciitis,  I'm also frugal and don't want to spend over $80 on a pair of running shoes.  I did some research to find the best pair of shoes for large runners.  So these Asics came up and for $50.  Let me tell you, they have been well worth the purchase.  I can a shoe is going to work after I put them on and they fit comfortably right out of the box.  Had good arch support and didn't pinch my toes or the balls of my feet.  The tread on the soles haven't worn flat like some other name brands will after a short time.<br/><br/>The one reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that the sole on the inside part of the right shoe came undone after about 7 weeks.  Still a great shoe."
"asics These running shoes are worth every penny, even though I don't run in them. I am a walker and they fit perfectly without any problems of slipping or blisters. They are very comfortable and the second time I wore them, I walked 7 miles all over Chicago without a single issue.  I just may get another pair but in a different color. You can't go wrong with this shoe."
asics Love these. First time i tried Asics. Very satisfied with these. They are not so expensive but the quality the fit the everything is üíØ. Definitely would buy them again. I only wished their clothing wasn't so expensive. For the same money i can buy under armor. For sports clothing i wear champion. Good value good quality nice look.
"asics I bought these Asics as a gift for someone who is a big newbalance fan and who doesn't like the neon  colors on running sneakers. She owns a conservative pair of running NB now and wanted a running sneaker that is comfortable. I looked in the NB line and couldn't find anything that fit conservatively.. So I looked on line and Asics came up not only Top Rated but comfortable and gave me options for a sneaker to fit her needs without the bright colors,.you could walk in and be nice enough to wear with jeans to go out.. Well I gave them to her and she loves them. They are comfortable for walking and standing. They are not loud and can easily be worn for going out to dinner with jeans or everyday use. .the only thing she didn't like is the loop on the back of the sneaker which will not allow your pants sit properly. So all sitting well now as she resolved the Issue and cut the loops off which make the sneaker also look nicer. We will see in time how they wear."
"asics I wore my new ASICS Running shoes for the first time today! I have a sciatica issue that I'm working through and part of the solution was the use of orthotics. I ordered these shoes a half size larger and I'm glad I did. The shoes fit perfectly! I have a comfortable fit but when I walked my pup this morning I had a squeak in both shoes, bummer. But during the walk, I deduced that it was the plastic of the orthotics rubbing against the sole shoe material. When I arrived home I immediately talked both shoes and the squeak was gone! Silence is golden! I then when to the gym and worked out for an hour and I'm pleased to say that there were no irritations, squeaks or break in challenges. Although they still feel new, a little stiff, they worked out better than expected! I would highly recommend these shoes!"
"asics UPDATE to my previous post: These shoes are TOO SQUEAKY. Almost everyday I wear these to work (office environment) someone comments about the squeak. I would not buy this particular shoe again.<br/><br/>[Original post: Comfortable shoes BUT really noisy. I've worn them for 2+ weeks and they continue to squeak, loud enough that people in my office hear my coming down the hall!]"
"asics I loved these shoes at first! They fit great, and I wore them for the first time during a 10K and my feet felt great afterwards! Never had a pair of shoes I didn't have to break in and could run a race right off the bat and be fine in! But during a recent trip, noticed the rubber sole on the bottom was starting to peel away from the tip of the shoe. My shoes are less than 6 months old and have only been used a handful of times. Expected better craftsmanship. Feel great, but aren't lasting like I would expect them to."
"asics I think this is by far the best running shoe I have ever worn for under $50 bucks. I just went through a $100 pair of Nike's and was considering having my pinky toes amputated. There's no comparison, and I feel duped into thinking I was getting the best shoe with a wing on the side for years!  Well those just hit the trash!<br/><br/>The ASICS shoe is well constructed, down to the laces.  Super comfortable, yet minimal weight.  I can't describe the support, but every step feels like a cushion. Color and size were accurate in the description. 2-day shipping was spot on as they arrived on a Sunday. Today I ran a quick 3.1 miles with no swelling. Simply amazing! I'm now considering purchasing a second pair for backup."
asics I ordered a pair of these a year ago to help cure plantar fascitis.  They are one of the few shoes I have not had to put inserts for arch support and comfort.  They do not aggravate the PF pain.  I wore them out and even cut them accidentally with a chain saw.  Now they are my work shoes.  I just ordered this new pair for dress shoes.  Five stars.
asics One of my favorite  pairs of walking / running shows. With these shoes on my surgically reconstructed ankle feels wonderful. I liked them so much I bought two additional pairs.
"asics Have tried these because of excellent experience with Asics Cumulus which I have used past 10yrs. These are for hiking. A little different fit but after my feet got used to stiffer sole, they are as hoped. Hard to beat the price. Threw out my Merrells and Keens which were highly rated, but I found unsatisfactory for long hikes-too stiff, too hot, not enough room for toes when your feet get hot on 10-12mi hikes.<br/>Order these 1/2 size larger for the right fit. My 8.5 fits nicely in a size 9."
asics These are really good shoes. Some of the best I have ever bought. But they are the first pair Asics shoes I have bought. Very well made quality shoe. 4 stars for the sizing. They have a very narrow toe box which required sending them back and exchange for half size larger. These fit fine and I like the very much. Fortunately Amazon makes exchanges fairly easy
"asics Third pair! I stumbles across these on a discount rack a few years ago and figured I'd give them a try and now they are a staple. Comfy, breathable and light. They do have somewhat soft soles that wear down but to be expected from a trail shoe. Nice for walking but solid enough for some moderate hiking too."
"asics So far seem to be good shoes, pretty comfortable, although not as cushy as I would have thought. I do deliveries all day, and am on my feet intermittently 12-15 hours a day, and even at the end of the day still feel pretty good, much better than some far more expensive brands.<br/>They do run a bit on the small side though, suggest ordering a half size larger than normal, and if you usually get a wide, order the extra wide."
"asics Ok these are great trail shoes. The grip on the sole feels solid when I am running. The fit is quite nice too. I feel comfortable running through the woods over dirt, sticks, different elevations, gravel, and anything else I encounter.<br/><br/>The shoe itself feel very solid too. Like my foot is well supported."
"asics I bought these for my busy husband who gave the thumbs up on the colors after seeing them online. He's worn ASICS for years, which makes it an easy and predictable purchase when he needs a replacement. I bought his typical size (9.5M) and he says they feel as good as always. Keep making a quality product and he'll be a loyal customer for life."
asics I like this particular shoe. I had the same model with a different color in the past so I knew what size I needed. I use them 90% of the time to go on my walks. The last pair lasted about a year so hoping for the same length of wear on this pair. I took them out of the box and went on a 5 mile walk with no hot spots or discomfort.
"asics I have a hard time finding shoes that i like. I usually just go to the store and try on a few a pairs of shoes until i find something i kind of like. So, when prime day came around, i took a chance and ordered these shoes.This is my first pair of Asics, and I have to say i'm impressed with the fit, toe room, comfort, and how well made these shoes are made. i work 12 hour shifts, and i'm on my feet a lot. So, when these shoes arrived, i laced them up and went to work. The comfort is there, and my feet didn't get sore from the many steps i take throughout the shift. i definitely found a brand that i can trust to go back to and order online again."
"asics I love the way these shoes look, and the way they feel.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Inexpensive, good quality shoes<br/>Attractive design goes well with shorts or pants<br/>Comfortable all day<br/>Lightweight<br/>Good traction, wet and dry<br/>Fit very well<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>None that I can think of"
asics Very comfortable and nice looking shoe. I spend about ten hours a day in these and on my feet. They are very light and fit true to size. I only wish the tongues were attached so they wouldn't slide to the sides.
"asics Good quality build, but SUPER stiff, and actually hurt just walking around on carpet . Going back to newbalance.Also, the ASICS 4E is more like a 2E in newbalance...meaning, still quite narrow. Also, NOT FREE RETURNS. Unlike other Prime items, you have to pay to have the item picked up at your home"
"asics VERY HIGH INSTEP and VOLUMOUS FEET &gt; 14 /4-E  Usable,  ( unlike MANY )  Hoping they will improve &gt; use less than 5 miles.currently.<br/>A little warm, but WELL BUILT , and U can feel the cushions.  WELL worth Purchase,,,, I HAVE a horrible time with foot wear, and usually use Chicos &gt; 13"
"asics Disappointed with this. I've been buying Asics for years due to my 12E size. The bottom of the shoe came totally unglued on the right shoe from toe to arch. I had to reglue it. Left show no hint of coming apsrt. Must be a quality control issue, or an end of the line whoops, we're out of glue event."
"asics Very excellent shoe.  Well cushioned through out the sole.  Runs slightly large in the toe-box.  I wear size 12D (medium) and these shoes were a little wide and maybe just a tiny bit long.  Not enough of a problem for me to return them.  Remember, your foot is going to swell as you run.  Good looking shoe.  I'd buy them again."
"asics These shoes are great! As a large guy (300 lbs), I searched and searched for the right shoe, to fit right, support my weight and for someone that is borderline diabetic. This model kept coming up on online reviews and searches. I have been wearing these for a couple of weeks now and the pain in my feet (that I was experiencing due to broken down newbalance shoes) has become much more bearable. At times, I feel as though I am walking on clouds!<br/><br/>These are my first ASICS and I really love their construction, their fit and the style. In fact, I purchased two pair, the Silver / Grey / Royal and the Black / Onyx / Charcoal. Time will tell in how they really hold up. To be continued...<br/><br/>Search key words: Fat Guy Man Overweight Obese Diabetes Walking"
"asics The 14 D was too tight, 14 4E was too large and felt like it would slip right off my heel. Why no in between sizes? a 2E would have been ok with me. I wanted to try Asics out as the NB brand trail runners seem to have gotten tighter and smaller for all the new models. Guess I'll have to keep looking."
asics they feel great. i needed no sneakers for a trip which was going to include a ton of walking. they fit perfect and i was able to walk all day with them. Especially right out of the box with out breaking them in. im a heavy set guy and i was worried that these would not hold up but they're perfect.
"asics These are the perfect shoes for any athletic activity. I got these because I needed knew shoes to start training to join the marines. I'm a pretty big guy at 6ft 238lbs. And on top of that I have flat feet. These shoes work great and are quite comfortable no matter what I do. And I've been on 10-12mi jogs and a few hikes.<br/>What I really like about the shoes, how it flexes at the heel when I'm lifting or just in general. The only thing I don't like is when I pull the tongue to tighten my shoes I can't pull it too much or else it pulled up the tip of the shoe."
"asics Once I received the shoes and tried them on, they were somewhat larger than a good fit and I thought the styling was a little forward for running shoes, the pointy toes in particular.  Also, they were about 2 1/2 times more costly than another brand of similar shoes that fit well and looked proper for their purpose."
"asics Second pair of ASICS I've gotten, like them just as much as the first pair.  I have some pretty wide feet, so it's nice to find a comfortable shoe that accommodates them."
asics Probably my 10th pair of Asics over the years. Loved getting the color I wanted. Hate shopping at a shoe store because they are always out of my size. This is the 1st pair of shoes I have ever ordered on line.  Comfortable with this purchase because I wear the same size of these year after year.
"asics I've got these shoes before, good quality.  However, I went ahead and got M medium 'normal' size which is actually very narrow.  You only have a choice between the 'normal' very narrow or ultrawide for these and other shoes.  The actual medium wide 2E doesn't ever seem to be available for any size."
"asics I've been committed to ASICS for last 5 yrs, usually good fit and strong support.  This pair fit very narrow in the middle of the foot, but lose in the heel.  After a few months, the inside of the heel has torn and worn thru causing blisters . Although these seemed like a good value - they will only last a couple months - very poor quality (made in China)."
asics So far has been a pretty good running shoe. I just started running again 6 months ago and am doing 15-20 miles per week. I only wear them whiles running so I can't say how they do as an every day shoe. I ordered the 4E and I have plenty of room. Starting to wear a hole in the liner back by the heels. I am ordering another pair for when these wear out. I have picked up a pair of Mizuno and although they were lighter they just didn't fit as well.
"asics I found these shoes to be reasonably comfortable, and wanted to like them. However, one glaring issue with them was a rather shallow heel cup which made it impossible for me to comfortably wear my orthotic heal inserts without feeling like my heels would pop out constantly as I walked, let alone ran. The upper seemed reasonably well made and comfortable. The sole looked ok, though I could see the areas that looked like they were ripe for separation of the tread from the sole as commented by others in the reviews. I ultimately returned these because the shoes simply wouldn't be versatile enough for me to wear both without AND WITH my orthotic inserts. Otherwise, I probably would still have them and be wearing them, as they were comfortable when worn without my orthotic inserts, and I thought they looked nice. And they were a good price."
"asics Crap shoe. The Venture must be the low end quality of Asics because I own three other models (Quantum 360, Kayuno, and GT2000) and these pale in comparison. Not comfortable as they are very stiff. Not cushy enough. I suspect they don't have the same gel as the others I mentioned. Not recommended."
"asics These Asics Gela Venture 5 are the most comfortable and supportive shoes I have purched, I own three pairs they've went from new, to my work shoes, to my yard work shoes.<br/>I am 6'3"" 20 lbs and I am very hard on shoes and I need a lot of support not to mention that I'm a diabetic."
"asics I have tried running with work shoes, sneakers, and other shoes but I always ended up feeling some sort of discomfort either while running or after. I figured, OKAY, FINE, buy some running shoes that are actually made for running... and you know what? It was worth it!! :0 I didn't feel any discomfort during or after running, in fact I felt my performance while running was much better! I also use these shoes for working out and it's convenient for walking around and staying active. I personally recommend that if you buy a pair of these shoes, buy a half size bigger than your foot, and make sure that if you have a wide foot, that you buy the wide version, and not the usual narrow version of these shoes. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later."
"asics Transitioned from the GEL-CONTEND 3 to the VENTURE 5...in my personal opinion this shoe is less comfortable...it has a ""plastic like"" feel to the material resulting in less flexibility and comfort. Overall, not a bad shoe compared to the market, but not the CONTEND 3 in quality"
"asics My husband was so pleased to get these in the mail! They fit him perfectly and looked slimmer on than I imagined. Very comfortable he wanted to walk all over the house with them, his feet were very thankful!! LOL<br/>Will definitely be buying another pair soon, hubby likes to work outdoors ;)"
asics Second time in the same year I purchased these comfy shoes.  First time a 10.5 which was a little snug but I made it last for 7 months.  This time I went up to 11.5 and it is a perfect fit.  I am normally a 10.5W so word to the wise when ordering this pair of shoes.  Go a whole size up.  Great buy though.  Use them for work and gym time.  Like I said the first set lasted 7 months!!
"asics I have tried other brands of running shoes.  I am a fat bastard and wear them for the support, I definitely do not run.  That being said this brand of running shoe is the only one I wore when I was in the Army that did not leave my feet hurting the next day after a long run for PT.<br/><br/>I wear these to walk and work out in.  The ASICS Venture 5 have been my go to sneaker since they came out.  I have had them in multiple colors and just love them.  My wife and son both LOVE the ASICS Venture 5."
"asics I got these for my son for work as they need all black shoes. They fit perfect, and they're very comfortable for all day standing. (According to him!) I will say, they are not TOTALLY black, but thus far he's slid by with the dark grey/silver on them.<br/><br/>Comfy, and practical."
"asics Probably the cheapest running shoes I have ever bought (I paid $41). I am not a runner, but my Dad is marathon-level and blows through the more<br/>expensive ($100+)  Asics ""Gel Forte"" T390N shoes like Kleenex. So, I get a lot of his ""hand-me downs"" that are only a few months old, where a very small specific part of the sole is worn down. I wear running shoes whenever I am not at work, and now I have tried out both a Venture and a Forte.<br/><br/>This is a similar shoe. Compared to the Forte, my impression is the Venture is a little ""tighter"". The treads on the bottom are a little more defined so they may grip the road better. They look better than the Fortes in my opinion and after a quick break in period are decently comfortable."
"asics Love ASICS shoes. Got these Gel Venture 5 instead of Gel Foundation 8, which I've been wearing for years but don't seem to be available in my size now, and they are a good substitute. I like the F8's more as they give a little better cushion but the V5's are great to wear around town."
"asics Decent cushioning, very good price.  Love that I can get these in size 15 with 4e width.  Asics, please don't stop making big and wide shoes- these are the best comfort options out there for us freaks with big, huge feet."
asics I like the color/style design. Well made. Good materials and feels durable. The price is very competitive.<br/><br/>However I have to return it as I am looking for something for mostly walking and light running. The bottom is a little stiff for my purpose. Wish I could use it.
asics Great styling and comfortable. The cushioning is excellent in the heel which is important during long walks. Very good price point.
"asics I have been wearing these for a month with Doctor Scholl's plantar fasciitis inserts and my feet feel amazing. I forgot what it felt like to walk without pain until I bought these. If you are on a budget and need comfortable shoes, look no further. I wear 13 wide (4e) and they fit great."
"asics Asics are the only shoe I consistently find fit me well and are comfortable. I looked at similar Asic model in the store, but they didn't have my size. Lo and behold, Amazon had the size and color I wanted for less money than the store. I haven't done any hard running in these yet, but they've had great grip and comfort for the walking and running I've done so far."
"asics I am a fan of ASICS. First ""sneaker"" I ever put on that were immediately comfortable. While initially designed as an athletic type shoe, their fit and comfort are great for everyday wear. This is the first time I have ordered them online but ordered based on sizes previously purchased and they fit great. Would definitely purchase again through online/Amazon format."
"asics This is a decent shoe for the money.  The uppers are well made and comfortable once the padding conforms to the foot.  My only real complaints are with the sole.  The first problem is that the sole contains many nooks and crannies that capture pebbles.  Every time I use the shoe outside I come back with rocks stuck in my soles.  This can cause annoying clicking on pavement and scratch floors indoors.  The second problem is that the soles aren't very substantial.  The little triangle features in the center front of the shoe are quickly worn away and underneath them is only about 1 mm of rubber.  I don't think I've ever worn through a sole more quickly than these.  The uppers are barely worn, but the soles are nearly flat in some areas.  A sole with some more meat on it like the old Nike Pegasus would make this shoe a better value."
"asics I purchased these, along with another pair of ASICS running shoes, and I couldn't be happier. As one who has suffered from extreme foot pain, for most of my 70 years on this planet, I have to say, this particular brand of shoe, has been superior in alleviating the pain, than any of the other brands of shoes that I've purchased over the years. They seem to have excellent arch support, they're light, and have good ventilation to keep your feet cool. Time will tell, how good they really are, and how well they hold up."
"asics I have bought the Gel series of ASICS shoes for a number of years now, so fitting wasn't a problem.  This time around as I'm getting serious about running again, I went online and researched the best running shoes for big guys like myself.  I was surprised to find this shoe at or near the top of multiple lists I came across.  Great arch support and a soft step, but most importantly, an incredibly light shoe for a size 13 wide!"
"asics I bought these 6 months ago and they've held up great!  They are still comfortable wearing all day.  Usually at 6 months my shoes or boots are trashed.  These have really surprised me on the quality and price.  I've had $100+ Asics fall apart in this time frame (soles coming unglued), but not these!!!"
"asics Best shoes I have ever owned. Been working 8 hours a day constantly walking on them for 2 years now and they still are in good condition with barely any rips or tears. Very impressed.<br/><br/>Also great for people prone to get blisters on the bottom of their feet, as the gel acts like a gel sole but built in.."
"asics These shoes are great for jogging; already have over 500 km (300 miles) on them and expect another 200+ km before replacement. I make sure to have a backup pair in-house well before my current pair wears out.<br/><br/>I also use Powerstep Protech Control Full Length insoles with these, due to issues with my gait. Since I started using these insoles, I haven't had any leg issues."
asics I'm no pro runner. I want to die just running ONE mile but I'm just trying to make my man boobs smaller and the shoes are helping so far.
"asics Just finished a six mile break-in walk. Very happy with the fit and construction of these shoes so far. I was a little anxious when I ordered the 9 4E's, as I normally have needed a 9.5 2E in other shoes. However I took the advice from Amazon's 3D recommendations based on my current shoes (newbalance 890 v5's size 9.5 2E.) Amazon was spot on! The 9 4E ASICS fit like a glove right out of the box.<br/><br/>Will see how these hold up as I ease them into my current running workouts (10-15 miles per week mixed road / trail). But so far I am delighted with the purchase."
"asics If I can be picky...The size chart is good, but this is my second pair of Asics in recent years so I would have to say a little snug and one shoe was a little more snug then the other. I also felt the arch on the one side more then the other. Having said that its nothing worth returning, I loosen the laces a little and they are already breaking in fine. For the money and convienence I am impressed. I will definitely go for another pair."
"asics I wanted to see how these were compared to the Cumulus and Nimbus.  Clearly you get what you pay for... These are less than half the price, but night and day difference with the fit, feel, and function. I would not recommend them for running or walking any kind of long distance. Go up the product spectrum."
asics I don't know what exactly wrong with shoes! But after wearing them for like 10 mins ...my right feet start hurting from arch! It's like internal pain due stretch but the left is always okay! I tried 2 different times but same problem...overall shoes look very smart and I think the GEL part is over hyped and these are not really that comfortable
"asics I just bought a second pair of these sneakers as my first are starting to wear out. These are very comfortable. I have a high arch and found I still need a basic insert, but with that simple addition the Venture 5s are one of my favorite all-purpose sneakers I've ever had."
asics If you're a runner and you have wide feet these shoes are the best. I run about 4 miles a few times a week and these shoes have held up for quiet some time and are really comfortable. This is my second pair of the same shoe and will more than likely continue to purchase when these start to wear down too much.
"asics I'm female, size 10.5-11 wide. The Asics in women didn't fit me correctly. I'm inbetween sizes. This men's 8.5 wide fits perfectly. Feels like I'm walking on clouds. Light-weight and flexible, yet supportive. I'm switching from Brooks and newbalance-I've found my new shoe."
"asics I really like how well they fit and I followed some of the other reviewers advise and went 1/2 a size bigger. The new shoes really look nice with jeans.  Very good quality, just like my last pair (which I did not order from Amazon, they were a gift and I am in for life now)."
"asics Fits just right. I am used to Nike Shox, so these don't have quite the same support or impact absorption, but they are very light weight, and economical. They don't seem to be the strongest built, but not bad for around the house, which is exactly what I bought them for."
"asics Bought as a gift for my dad, and he described the shoes as very comfortable, and that they are so lightweight that they feel like they're almost not there at all. He used them at the gym, this is a new addition to his gym collection that is filled with older ASICS that are still in great condition even after years of use."
"asics I consistently fit an 11.5 in Asics, and these were no different, fitment was perfect. I have very flat feet and many shoes I can't wear for more than 4 or 5 hours, these are remarkably good for the price and can wear them all day. Light weight and seem to breathe well."
"asics I like to walk around 3 to 4 miles per day but have been suffering from plantar fasciitis. I was hoping for some shoes with good arch support. These have been perfect so far (about 3 weeks of usage). They are comfortable, supportive, and fit perfectly. I'm very happy with the purchase! I'll update the review if anything changes."
"asics These shoes are nowhere near as comfortable for all-around running (pavement, trail, etc) as the GT series are, but they do what they're supposed to as a trail shoe: the traction is harder, so it handles dirt and rocks well.  However, after a couple of months of use, I took a fall running downhill on hardpacked dirt because of traction loss.  So much for the efficacy of reversed sole tread.  I did better with the aforementioned GT series!  I think that more praxis could go into the design so that the performance isn't just dependent upon theory.  There could be less flex to the sole, too, as my feet wrap around rocks in a way that cause a bit of pain on the trail - something I'd be buying Five Fingers for if I desired it.  Inexpensive shoe, so you've got some compromises.  We'll see how durable the soles are..."
asics Well firstly I am weight lifter and a runner. That being said here are the pros and cons of these shoes.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Fits the size you get.<br/>2. Out of the box these shoes feel amazing on the feet.<br/>3. They need almost no breaking in.<br/>4. The grip on the feet feels great on multiple surfaces.<br/>5. Decent color choices.<br/>6. The price on these shoes is great not only for the brand but for the simple fact that your suppose to replace running shoes every 6 months<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The laces are to long. I ended up switching them out with the lock laces.<br/>2. You will get blisters in the beginning but after running a couple times your feet will break them in.
"asics Really like these shoes! I bought two pair. Several 10Ks behind me and like them the more I run in them. Well made. Great arch support. And I like that they run a little long because nothing worse than slamming your toes into the front of your shoes when you run. I also like the tread in that unlike my other two Nike Flex I own, the tread does not pick up rocks forcing you to stop and clear them. I'm a new fan of Asics Running."
"asics Shoe fits &amp; feels fine, so 4 or 5 star for that. However, all the light grey color is so very much darker than in the picture. So much darker I had to check that the model number on the box &amp; shoe tongue was correct-it is correct. T5N3N.1314 Light Grey/Graphite/Red."
"asics one of my favorite sneaker brands. I was glad to see i could by this on amazon. I need sneakers that have an indent on your heal and these are great for just that. I use these to exercise but they look great, If you want to just walk around they are light and comfortable all purpose. I would not recommend these for winter since they are clothe."
"asics A bit disappointed with the comfort of this one.  It's my third recent pair of Asics, and I am very impressed with the previous ones (Gel-Craze and Gel-Sonoma).  They are both candidates for the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned.  This is about the 4th day for these Gel-Venture, just for daily wear not running, and I sense a problem with the knobby sole pushing on the bottom of my foot, thereby reducing comfort.  This one is labeled a ""running"" shoe, so maybe that's my mistake.  The Craze and Sonoma are in the ""trainer"" category and have a flatter sole.  I'm gonna to look for ""trainers"" from now on.  If this improves over the next few weeks, I'll update the review."
"asics These are among the best shoes I've ever had. this is my second pair,even though the first pair I bought a couple of years ago are not quite ready for the trash bin yet. I'm thinking of buying another pair for future use. my foot is wide and these really accomodate."
asics I have been buying a different brand for almost twice the price. I bought these and they were to small. I sent them back for a refund and ordered the next size up. They fit good now and are comfortable. I walk five miles  everyday at 3.5 mph non-stop and was so happy with these I ordered a second pair. Time will tell how long they last.
"asics After trying all of the leading major brands of running shoes over the past 30-40 years, I recently stumbled across the ASICS line about 3 years ago.  From my first pair to this pair, they are the most comfortable and best fitting running shoes that I could ever ask for."
asics Really comfortable because I'm on my feet 12 hours a day and they keep my feet comfortable and no pain at the end of the day.
"asics I've always worn Asic's, they're great shoes that fit me and are comfortable. This is the first show by Asic that I thought did not meet my expectations of a walking/running shoe. The sole was stiff and not very well cushioned. I walk adn run trails and the tread was well designed but the flex was stiff and my feet tired after a few miles due to lack of impact protection.<br/><br/>They're neat everyday shoes, comfortable enough for wearing when not exercising and I'll keep them for that purpose. And, if you want to sacrifice comfort for stability on the trail, I suppose they can work for that too; they are stable but just not flexible or cusioned enough for my style of trail running."
"asics I followed Amazon's size suggestion and the fit was perfect.  These are great for walking and everyday use. Nothing out of this world. They do their job. I walk a lot so I wear shoes pretty fast. It's great to know I can just reorder, without worrying whether the size would be correct or not."
"asics These shoes have held up well so far running twelve miles a week for two months.  I'm very much a novice runner and I've never bought ""Running Shoes"" before but these have been a pleasant experience and I would recommend even with my admittedly limited knowledge."
"asics Well, Asics always give me the perfect match between comfort and style. This shoes are excellent to walk to my work and use in casual occasion."
"asics Started experiencing plantar fasciitis so I purchased these for additional support. To soon to give it a 5 star as I've only had them for a short period of time. I would like to mention that the sole has many small crevices that while good for traction, will carry dirt/sand into the house more so than other shoes."
asics I bought these shoes to wear as my everyday after work pair. Fit is comfortable and they look good. Flash forward about 3 months and the shoes begin making a noise when I walk. A squeaking noise with each step. Both shoes. The noise is so problematic that I feel like George on Seinfeld with his whooshing pants. I'm considering buying a different pair of shoes because of the noise. I may try to record a video that captures the noise and update my review.
"asics I've been using vibram five fingers shoes to run for the past 4 years. During that time, i was running about 3 or 4 times a month but since the new year i've been running 3 day/week. I'm usually wear a 10.5 and these fit but they're a little tight. I ran in them for 3 miles a couple days ago and they felt nice. Every step/impact felt comfortable because of the gel inside. I really need to get used to buying running shoes again but not bad overall."
"asics Awesome! The color combination is great and they as comfortable as a shoe can be.  I only wear these to walk when I travel because I tend to spend a lot time by foot, and they are a relief.  Much better than other sporty brands!<br/>These size actually is correct on the length, and because of previous experience, I selected a wider factor and it fits perfect.  Keep that in mind!"
"asics Great shoe apart from the fact the laces broke within one week of normal use on my trip to Cuba where you can't buys shoe laces,  hence the 2 stars. Always held asics to a high standard until now. Shoes seem to be holding up., just cheap crappy laces let them down."
"asics My previous pair from several years ago was fabulous. This pair shows the exact same specs but is narrower. I've tried to make do but they just aren't as comfortable, so I need to decide whether to jump to a wider one or another brand."
"asics Asics Men's Gel-Venture 5 are great fitting, long lasting, wide based shoes with excellent support. I walk 5-6 miles a day, or hike 3 miles through rocky terrain. These shoes help with stability and have enough cushioning and tread to keep you safely on the trails with no foot or joint pain. Highly recommend!"
"asics For some reason ASICS shoes seem like the most comfortable fit for my feet.  Also, I had an odd accident a few years ago and really damaged a large toe, ASICS are the only shoe that makes that toe feel just right.  This is the first time that I tried a running shoe and with this particular type of shoe from ASICS the shoe size is a tiny bit on the large size. Otherwise spot on."
asics I have bought my husband a couple pairs of these and he loves them. They fit his feet perfectly.<br/>He's been working outside in them a lot and is wearing his other two pair. And wants some. Ew ones<br/>This pair is a gift for our upcoming anniversary.
asics I bout the Light Grey / Graphite / Red ones size 13. I am 240#. First want to point out how the light grey looks almost tan in the picture but is  light grey in color as stated. This shoe is my light off pavement primary shoe. It is easy to clean and dries fast. Mud cleans off easy and does not build up to bad when walking. lose deeper sand and traction is just ok but it climes sand stone very well. I could if necessary walk in these all day on pavement but the traction on these shoes will wear out faster than other styles for just pavement. Traction is very well suited for spirited walking on dirt and rocks. I only lightly jog in these on occasion mostly fast walking and light climbing. I will buy these again probably the light blue ones for verity before these even get close to wearing out.
"asics I purchased these for my dad for his birthday and he loves them. I'm always nervous purchasing clothing items online, but these shoes run true to size. My dad thinks they are very comfortable. He loves asics shoes.<br/>They look great and are well made."
"asics After reading reviews on these shoes, I decided to order them a half size smaller than what I normally wear. When I first put them on they were tight, but they stretched well and fit perfectly. I use these four days a week. For both cardio and strength training. I love the color and I love the feel. They are a little narrow, but fight through that at the beginning and they will stretch and fit better. I wore them around my office at work all day one day (I get about three miles of walking in a day at work just around the office) and then started working out in them. I love them. I would recommend these to anyone. Only negative is some of the threading has started to come apart, but has not affected their stability or function since it's up near the front of the tongue."
"asics The shoes fits well, I run about 4-6 miles 5 days a week and these shoes have been pretty good. Shoes offer plenty comfortability and good support. I'm feel happy with my purchase over all due to price and feel of the shoes. My only complaint is the quality control, some parts of the stitching aren't perfect, even the cut-out designs on the heel meaning just cosmetic design imperfections. Other than what I mentions you do get what you pay for and maybe a little bit more with this one so 3/5 fair as can be."
asics Arrived in good condition.  Fit as expected.  I have been wearing Asics for numerous years and have not been disappointed.<br/>Amazon Prime service has let me down lately: items ordered on Thursdays have not been delivered until the following Monday.
"asics I tried it on in store and seemed to fit fine but the pair I got in the mail seems larger.  It does not fit like the 2100 series which I have had for years.  Very uncomfortable for my particular foot after wearing, the soul is not cushiony and the shoe overall is too wide. I tried a more supportive soul and the soul it too short and does not reach the top of the toe which rubs on my toe."
"asics This is my second pair of the Gel-Venture trail shoe. I use this shoe on combined paved street-paths and trails on the California North Coast. My current pair is beginning to wear at the corner near my small toe, otherwise the uppers are still in great shape. The inserts are completely worn down and soles are still good. I've worn many ASICS shoes for several years now. I'm size 8 and ASICS shoes do run a little small as noted on websites and reviews so I wear the size 8.5 normal width. Good fit in the toe box. A very good utility shoe without spending a lot of money and the shoe holds up. Kevin Metcalfe"
"asics Dude...  this is like my 20th pair of Asics.  Been wearing this brand since 2004 and have never looked at any other brand.  I have worn Brooks, Adidas, Reebok, Nike just to name a few and Asics are the better shoe,  for me and my feet anyway. You just need to find what fits your hoof and stick with it."
"asics I ordered these shoes a couple of weeks ago, i bought the carbon, black, hot orange design, the shoe is very comfortable and light but BEWARE! because the sole of the shoe is made from rubber it can be very slippery and can potentially result in injury if you run or walk during rainy weather, since i couldnt go outside i tried working out indoors but as soon as you start to sweat and that sweat hits the floor you'll find yourself sliding across the room like Tom Cruise in that dancing scene from Risky business, another problem is the lack of ventilation causes the shoe to smell if you wear it for too long, my feet dont smell when i wear any of my other shoes."
"asics ASICS are perfect for me because I wear a 13, but a big 13, ASICS EURO size for this shoe is a 48, which is just a little larger than other manufacturers 13""s, which run 47 - 47.5 in EURO. Just that little bit make all the difference in the world."
"asics Nice shoe but I replaced the laces w/Lacelok rubber stretch laces for my own idiosyncratic whim,so sue me. But it neatened them up and gives me a slip on/off ease.Also the stretch laces lock a perfect snugness in,making for a very good tight bounce.For real."
asics I've been wearing the Gel-Equation but decided to try this. So far it seems great. Seems a bit more sturdy. Fit is the same and it has the same removable insole to accommodate orthotics though the factory insoles are very comfortable. Good value too.
"asics I bought these because a previous post said he orders them for work.  I must say I agree, I am always on the go at work and this pair of shoes are nice.  I am sure there are other pairs that might be better, but knowing what I know these are at least better than my last pair."
asics I am extremely happy with this purchase.  Actually this is the second set of these shoes I have ordered.  I liked the first pair as they were comfortable and wore well.  These fit well and looked good and the price was about half of what another brand cost for a comparable shoe.
asics If money wasn't tight I would have purchased another pair of GEL-Nimbus shoes.  Much more comfortable and better support.  Though you can't complain when these are half the price.
"asics I do wedding photography and videography so I'm on my feet all day and on the move constantly. I needed a shoe that is durable and comfortable and I found that with this one. Usually, I'm having to put get insoles or deal with the shoe just not holding up but these shoes have been solid so far and they don't kill my feet."
"asics I honestly think Asics are the only shoe I can buy on the internet and know they're going to fit beautifully...NO surprise, they came today and feel like I'm walking on a cloud. A VERY high quality shoe under 50 bucks!<br/><br/>Buy this shoe, you won't regret the decision."
asics I ordered these for my husband. He typically wears a 9.5 in Nike. Ordered a 10 in Asics and he loves them! He can wear them all day without fatigue to his feet. He is constantly on the go and walks four miles a day in addition to his busy job. Will definitely reorder once he needs a new pair!
"asics Fairly attractive, light-weight shoe that is not too hot.  Tread is not too prone to slipping on trails or wet sidewalks during walks, and though perhaps not the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn, they are certainly enough so that I'd order them again."
"asics So far so good....nice looking...reasonable price....purchased for 3 mile exercise walk...very comfortable so far...would recommend.....used to purchase/run in Asics years ago and was never disappointed...nothing has changed, they still make a very good product."
asics I found these sneaker to be somewhat uncomfortable. after wearing them for a couple of hours my feet hurt sufficiently enough that I had to stop what I was doing to change them off for another sneaker. Would recommend purchasing a wider size.
"asics Nice shoes.  I've worn NB shoes for years and these were a bit cheaper so I figured I'd give them a try.  They fit good and are really nice after having the same pair of shoes for years.  Nothing against NB, either.  Nice to have options on shoes.  maybe these will last as long too..."
"asics Well fitting shoe. With Asics, I always have to order a half size up. Wore them part of first two days and full time after that. Ordered them for walking trails and they keep me from slipping on the trails. Would definitely buy this shoe again. Only reason I took one star off was that they don't  have quite the same cushion as their expensive models."
"asics Great shoes for someone with bad knees or ankles. I have two pair of this, one in gray and blue the other in black and gray they are so comfortable that I bought this for my dad and he loves them. Will be ordering more as I need them. Thnaks"
"asics I dont wear these any longer, they never broke in and softened up like all my other asics. I paid more for my others , maybe this is why the flexibility is so poor that I just put them away. Goodwill here they come, no more 40$ asics for me"
asics I ordered this pair because they had the most reviews. but they are kinda too large and Heavy compare to some nice running shoes. they work fine for inside gym or for some outside workout. i am not an expert runner but I would order another pair for a long run.
"asics Padding was very thick initially, but after a couple weeks of wear they fit quite well."
"asics Very comfortable and seems to be the correct width.  My only issue is that the toe box feels a bit too spacious.  Very comfortable and no blisters.  These are my first ASICS, so maybe they run just a tad looser than other brands I have worn.  I might try the 2E instead of 4E next time to see."
asics Very good shoe for the money. I have wide feet at the ball of the foot and Asics is my go-to brand. These shoes are well made and are holding up as expected. Also like the style and color as they go with most any casual clothes I might wear.
"asics I am really happy to have found some great alternatives to the $130 shoes I have been buying. I grabbed 2 different pairs (colors) of these and really love both of them. They replace Brooks Cascadia 10, and although 2 different types of shoes, the comfort is what I was going for. With 2 pairs of these, I am still up over $30."
"asics I normally buy shoes in-store so I can try them on and test the fit, but for $49.99 I figured I could take the risk. ASICS are my favorite brand of shoe because they're made well, they fit well, and they last for a long time. The pair I received were exactly what I was hoping for, and I know they'll last a good year or so like my last pair. Then again, they might not be right for you; I'd recommend visiting a local running store if you're unsure, and they'll likely have someone there who can evaluate your running style and determine what would be best within your budget. If you like ASICS shoes, this is a good pair of ASICS shoes."
"asics These are absolutely great running shoes. I log about 20 miles a week, which isn't yet an unreasonable amount, and these shoes have held up to the wear and tear of everything I have thrown at them. They have gone through mud and salt water and come out just fine from the wash. The soles still hold up great and the arch support is still fine even after a year of consistent running. I am sure at some point these shoes will wear out, and when they do I will be right back here ordering another pair. I already ordered a pair for my girlfriend who I am getting into running, and immediately her mileage this past week is way up with less pain and injury. Highly recommend these shoes."
"asics Great running shoes!  Very comfy, looks stylish for even everyday wear paired with black socks.  Good cushion when doing some heavy runs, hopefully it holds up for at least a year, definitely a keeper.  ASICS always have the runners in mind!"
asics This was my first online shoe buying experience and I can say I am very satisfied. The shoes look good and have a solid build quality. There is a lot of support at the heal and arch of this shoe that makes you feel like you could stand or walk in these shoes for very extended periods of time without any issue. Another big plus for me is not paying an arm and a leg for a new pair of tennis shoes. This is because (and I don't know if it's the way I walk or what) I tend to go through shoes pretty fast. Some last 2 years some last 6 months. I'll be even more impressed if these end up lasting more than a year for the low price I paid.
asics I've owned these for over one year. This is my second pair. I don't run. I use them for walking and everyday use. I find them so comfortable I forget I'm wearing them. I also use Lock Laces so slipping them on and off takes one second. Love 'em.
"asics I broke my own rule of not going cheap on jogging sneakers, and well, thats the problem.<br/>I think these are ok sneakers, specially for going to the gym and running treadmill but i do not recommend these sneakers for anything over a 10k.<br/>I just took these out on a 12k run and man, my feet are in PAIN. They also feel heavy.<br/>They seem well built but honestly you get what you pay for.<br/>Again, if you need sneakers for basic working out in a gym or a treadmill or maybe do weights, these are a great affordable option, but if you plan on jogging anything over a 10k I would highly discourage you from getting these."
"asics giving this a 3 because it is clearly nowhere near as comfortable as the Gel-Nimbus or Gel-Cumulous, but then again you get what you pay for and getting the more expensive line of Asics is definitely worth it if you have bad feet."
"asics I'm on my feet all day with work these are the 2nd pair of these I've used and I have legitimately loved both of them. Lasted a little over a y ear on the first pair (bought in July lasted until October the next year) with a lot of use, I work anywhere from 8-14 hours a day on my feet for most of it and they were my primary ""running around"" shoe so they saw a lot of wear in the year it took them to wear out."
"asics So far, so good. I bought two identical pairs; one for general use and one for work/school (I work at a hospital and am a nursing student). They're very comfortable and breath well...I get sweaty feet and these are great so far."
"asics Just as the gel venture 3s that I used to own, ASICS has made another shoe that fits perfectly with incredible comfort on and off the trails. These shoes have gone from being just my running shoes to being what I wear all day. As long as ASICS keeps up what it's doing here they'll have a repeat customer in me."
"asics Extremely comfortable...  I had bought another model 6 months ago that gave me a black toe that I am still recovering from.  When you buy a pair of Asics make sure you know your size (with Asics) and that you know which model suits your needs and the shape of your feet.  Apparently Asics shoes are not all made out of the same factory, and knowing your size only is not good enough to make it the perfect fit and purchase.  I knew this model had served me well in the past, so I purchased the Venture model which I knew was likely to be a good fit... And bingo! Perfect fit at half the price of brick and mortar stores."
"asics I usually buy specific shoes with a wide toe area so that I don't lose my second toenail after running. I love shoes with a wide toe area, but they are typically more expensive and last about the same duration as many other shoes. It always seems like I am going through shoes really quickly.<br/>  The Asics were recommended for people needed a little more room at the front of the foot. So I figured I would give these a try. These shoes feel much sturdier than I was expecting. They are light weight which is nice for longer duration walks/jogs. I feel very stabilized when walking. The Venture 5 also provides excellent cushioning. I'm very happy with these Asics."
"asics I use this while working and according to my Apple Watch, I range about 10-12 miles a day.  It's been about six months, it shows it's wear and tear but it's still going.  I had to change the insoles eventually but still goes."
asics I couldn't be happier with this pair of shoes - so much that I just ordered a second pair. I use them mainly for walking and at the gym. The fit is perfect and they are well cushioned.  I like the detail of the tab at the back of the shoe to hang them in the locker or to grab while putting them on.
asics I have been buying newbalance for a number of years but have been a little disappointed lately with the quality. My daughter recently bought a pair of ASICS and they seemed really nice so I thought I'd give a pair a try. I'm really glad I did. This is a great shoe for the price. As soon as I put them on I could tell that I was going to keep them. They give good support and are lightweight. I don't know yet about durability but I guess time will tell.
asics Great looking shoe. You can feel the support right off the bat. I ran 4 miles in my other shoes yesterday so Ill test these out on Friday and see how they do. I'm wearing them now at work and so far so good. I did adjust the laces because I had some serious pressure on the sides but it seems to have gone away since adjusting. I will provide an update after my run on Friday.
"asics I've worn nothing but Asics for 40 years (not including dress shoes, of course).  These shoes fit perfectly and if they're like all of my other Asics, they'll last me several years.  Excellent quality."
"asics Of all the Asics shoes I've bought, these are my least favorite so far. Perhaps because the pair I received was slightly wider and longer. They do appear to me to well constructed and will probably hold up better than the other pairs I've owned. But I'm not sure I'll be wearing them that long because I find them to be not as comfortable as I'd like. (I work on a concrete floor and walk many miles a day so I need a super comfortable shoe and these do not meet that expectation.) Personally will not be ordering another pair. Perhaps I need to look at other brands....This is just my experience so please take them as such. Your mileage will probably be different."
"asics Good shoe for the price.  Comfortable and nice looking. Have not used long enough to evaluate ruggedness or overall sustained use quality.  So far,  so good.  May rise to stars based upon continued performance under use."
asics Love these running shoes.  Because of some knee problems I cannot run as before but these suffice for walking and the occasional run off road.  I would not use these for serious running but they are great for my purpose.
"asics Needed a pair of everyday walking shoes, those had great reviews and the price was just right.<br/><br/>As for the fit, compared to other brands I've tried, those have ALOt of padding around the outside of the shoe. Not as noticeable after walking/running for about 10 miles, but those are also considerably warmer. My feet sweat a lot, and this just made the matter worse. Comfort is good, I like the sole and this has good rock protection on trails as well. I got a size 10 and it feels a little snug, this might improve with time as they break in a little.<br/><br/>I love the color and the look on those. I got the orange ones, and they look great!"
asics Normally 10.5 is a bit too narrow but these are snug and fit perfectly. Great quality shoe for the price.
"asics Light weight, fit perfectly ,sometimes a 14 is too big but not this one!"
"asics Great product and price. Worn them now for a couple days, one being in Chicago and going to the jimmy Buffet concert and they have great support and are comfortable. I plan to make these my new walking shoe and for the price getting another pair soon."
"asics Nice looking and comfortable, but a couple months into wearing these and I hear a squeak from the sneaker sole that is quite loud. Both make the noise when I walk, but the right one is much worse. Obviously, defective sneakers and inconsistent with a quality name company. They are out of the return period, so I am quite disappointed. ASICS should be informed as I would think they would also be disappointed. I will stop ordering footwear on Amazon due to this issue."
"asics Please note I am a serial ASICS user.  Fit is great.  Shoe has been in use for about 6 weeks.  Plenty of cushion for moderate (5-10 miles) hiking, walking or even running a couple miles on black-top.  Not enough sole firmness for hiking on walnut size jagged gravel.<br/><br/>I would have rated the shoes four or maybe five stars but the mesh turned from gray to red or purple from either too much sun, getting wet or residual bug repellent mist.  Never experience that before with an ASIC or any other shoe.  I missed the return window by 17 days.  Dang!"
asics These shoes fit as expected I used them as an all around runner. Thanks amazon
"asics Great shoes, especially for the low price.  I bought a pair of $115 ASICS running shoes two years ago on Amazon and I cannot really tell the difference between how they feel and these. They will be used mainly for casual walking."
"asics This is the third pair of these sneakers I have bought and I've been very happy with them.  I'm a nurse and my job means that I'm on my feet a lot.  This means that I need a comfortable sneaker.  These sneakers keep my feet comfortable for an entire twelve hour shift.  I also have another pair that I use at the gym.  They are also very good for jogging on the treadmill and I've noticed that since I started wearing them, I've less of a problem with shin splints."
asics Im not a person who buys a lot of shoes  because it would seem like I always have trouble with the way they fit but these fit better then expected and at the price I can't beat it. Will be buying more in the future
"asics I bought these shoes for my husband who works in a hospital.  He loved them at first,  but the sole started separating from the shoe after two nights of wearing them. I contacted the seller and because we didn't have the original box, they would not let me return them . I have asked for an exchange for just a new pair. Not holding my breathe. These are not worth the price you pay for them."
"asics I'm not sure what is wrong with these shoes but my feet feel really sore after I walk in them. I'm trying to figure out if they were the wrong type for me, but I like that they are light and have a lot of cushion."
asics These shoes are way smaller than advertised.  The shoelaces are impossible to tie when using all the holes.  Definitely need to get longer shoelaces if I plan on using these for anything other than city walking.
asics I love the fit of these shoes but I feel like this pair isn't holding up as long as my old trail runners. I've only had them for a few weeks and I'm noticing a lot of wear for not much time in them. Some stitching is coming loose in corners and the bottom rubber/plastic is wearing down. Although they are extremely comfortable and lightweight. Four stars from me.
asics I got these because I wanted to get in better shape. I am a heavy person who needed more cushioning during my exercise routine. The fit is great and my feet don't hurt after I workout. I highly recommend these.
"asics I've bought these shoes (venture series) for years due to their comfort, and removable insole that allows for me to use my orthotics.  I've been very happy with them."
"asics I bought these as walking/jogging shoes and I've only done about three miles in them so far. I just did a walk around the neighborhood to see how they'd feel. They have a lot of heel and ankle support and the gel insoles did a good job keeping my feet from hurting. I haven't gotten up to jogging speed yet, but I suspect they'll do well."
"asics Comfortable and supportive as I'm on my feet all day in the classroom and these fit my budget too. I would choose something else for serious hiking or trail running but for daily, everyday wear these are great."
"asics I wear a 11,5 wide and these fit perfect. Very comfortable, very light but well made. I also really like shoelaces since they don't come undone like most of the others. There's a Loy to like snout this shoe,"
asics I love these and will buy more.  I think this is a great deal for the price.  I use them on my treadmill everyday.  The older shoes I was using would give me heel blisters so I had to apply 3x3 bandages each day.  Both are exactly the same size.  I also love them for trail hiking.  I get out of the city 3 to 3 times a week to go hiking.  At my age (73) good traction is important when hiking and these fit that bill.
asics Was impressed at how well they fit. Very comfortable right out of the box as well. I'm a diabetic and I have to be very careful with my feet. These shoes are very comfortable when I walk 10-15 miles in a day. Thanks.
"asics I ordered the 4E size, not only because I have fairly wide feet but also because of the reviews. Good thing I did, these fit perfectly! I would suggest ordering at least 2E (if available) even if you consider your foot to be normal width, as seen on other reviews these shoes do indeed seem to run narrow in the middle. With that said I'm very happy with them. I walk a lot for exercise and have also started to run a bit, and needed to replace my shoes for this purpose. These ASICS are lightweight but still provide plenty of support, and are not nearly as warm as my previous shoes. Great value for the price. I would have only given 4 stars because of the narrow fit, but since I read the reviews and selected the wider version, the fit for me is excellent so my rating is as well!"
asics These are great shoes but run somewhat small. Did keep the shoes but now I wish I had not. 11.5 might have been just right. I purchased another brand of all purpose workout shoes size 11 and they were just fine.
asics Shoes are comfy and broke in fast but I have had them less then 3 months and they are already totally demolished and need replaced. Good shoe for the cost but don't expect them to make it for any span of time if you walk regularly like I do!
asics this is about my 30th pair of ASICS since i was 20 years old.  great running shoe and especially love the trail runner. you can always find a mid level shoe at a reasonable price and they are durable and comfortable.
"asics These shoes are wonderful for my feet. I'm pigeon toed, and I pronate, and ASICS tend to be the best for my feet. I can run for a while and not suffer any foot discomfort. I typically pair these with non-cotton running socks. I even just bought another pair in a different color in a Lightning Deal I like these so much! My last pair are now my walking around shoes, and when I wear these out, I'll retire them similarly. They are remarkably durable shoes. I definitely would buy, but I don't really recommend just buying shoes online: go get your feet fitted at a running store and find the perfect pair. If these fit you, though, you won't be disappointed."
asics These are my favorite shoes. They seem to work very well for me. I jog and walk through the out the day and also work on my feet 8-10 hrs a day and they hold up better than any other shoes I have bought.
asics I returned this item for a refund. The area above my toes was way too tight and actually painful. I'm 63 years old and have never had a pair of shoes so uncomfortable. I'd recommend shoes made by Vasque.
asics I found the arch support to be too far back inside the shoe. The arch support was placed in between my arch and my heel. This made the shoe very uncomfortable to wear.
asics This is the first time I ordered running shoes via Amazon.  The shoe runs on the small side.  I normally wear a size 9 1/2 and I ordered a size 10 and it fits perfectly.<br/>Very happy with this purchase.
"asics Love these shoes. Have sworn by Asics since running track in HS in the 80's. Great value, Great shoe for casual running. The fit was perfect. Lots of shock absorption. my old knees/shins/back appreciates."
"asics A great price for a good fitting, comfortable shoe.  I have size 13 feet, so I prefer to get black or dark grey shoes, so it doesn't look like I'm wearing pontoons for shoes.  These are well worth the price, and not too flashy, which I like. I usually wear NB or Merrell trail type shoes, and these seem to be just as good at half the price."
asics This is a running shoe that I have owned previously which was made in China.  This shoe was made in Vietnam and appears to have been made with a little less material but fits my foot size and is still comfortable to wear.
"asics Very comfortable and wearing down slower than expected. I wear them for dog walks and sprinting on concrete, and they've got a couple hundred miles on them already. They get a little hot and sweaty during the summer since they don't breath super well, but definitely worth the price."
asics I tried a pair of these on in Dick's Sporting Goods and loved how they felt.  I just started running and love the way these feel so far.  I wear an 11 or 12 for shoes and bought 11.5 and they fit perfect.  I will come back and update when I have worn these longer to give my thoughts.
"asics For me, they were not comfortable after a few hours of being on my feet, but it could be that I simply ordered a size too small.  I always have trouble finding shoes that fit.  I do love the look and the material seems to be of good quality."
asics Very good shoes. The fit is fine. I was surprised for 4E they don't seem any wider than some 2Es I have from newbalance. I use these to walk about 10 miles a day and after 2 weeks they are as good as new.
"asics Have not worn these shoes enough to have a complete assessment. They are the same shoes (different colors) of a  pair purchased a year or so<br/>ago and they have been very comfortable, durable and held their shape. No reason to believe these will be any different."
"asics I love ASICS shoes. I have been wearing this brand for 30 years.  I currently have 9 pairs for running, racquetball, hiking, and daily wear.  They always fit great, are light weight and very durable."
"asics These are the trail running cousin of the most popular running shoe in the world. It's popular for a reason. I loved running in the regular road shoe for years, and this is just as comfy and supportive. Going trail running or hiking or just traveling where you'll be doing lots of walking? Get them."
"asics They only had men's normal width and men's extra-wide. Extra-wide would have had the shoes sliding side to side while running, so I ordered normal, which turned out to be too narrow. Is there a return/exchange policy?"
asics The insoles on these are crap and the sizes have changed.
"asics Still wearing these and standing on concrete 10+ hours a day. Being a bigger guy on my feet all day is tough finding that right pair of shoes can be a pain and I've gone through way too many. I'm glad I found these and so are my feet. Light weight, comfortable and seem to last. I'll be getting another pair when the rubber wears thin."
"asics I like ASICS running shoes, in the past lasted well. The soles of this model seem a little lacking in grip but other than that and being a little large see of good quality and I hope will last for a year."
"asics I've bought these shoes before, quite few times and while they are a little stiff for running and wear out a little quicker than I'd like...they seem to be good value in an overcrowded and somewhat over-priced market place."
"asics I bought my first pair of these about a year and a half ago.  I am now on my third pair.  I now have started buying a few pairs at a time in case they stop making them.  I have high arches and put a Dr. Sch.  arch support insert in these shoes and my feet are comfortable all day.  I work on concrete a lot of my day, lifting and carrying lumber and cabinets.  These shoes hold up well.  I am pretty hard on them and have not had a pair fall apart yet,  unlike some other brands."
asics These look and feel great. Shin Splits went away instantly
asics I wear these as gym shoes and often continue to wear them to work at the office.<br/><br/>No one has ever commented on these not fitting in at either location.<br/><br/>Good all-around shoe.
"asics Not as comfortable as some ASICs I've owned that have gel insoles throughout. This only has gel in the heel. But, a good rugged shoe nonetheless. I've logged some running miles on these and eagerly look forward to next run. My goal is to try to wear them out so I can buy another pair of ASICs and to see just what kind of longevity these have."
"asics I have wide feet, so I usually buy newbalance. I have plantar fasciitis, so I like a comfortable shoe I can also wear to work. When I saw these in black and grey, I figured the price couldn't be beat, so I gave them a shot. Comfortable shoe. They look really good - much better than the cheap looking newbalance shoes that are available in this price range. The only slight downside is that they are absolutely more snug than my newbalance shoes. It isn't enough of an issue to make them unwearable, but with my next pair of Asics, I'll definitely try going up at least a half size."
asics This is my second pair and I love them. Nice amount of toe room and comfortable all day. I don't run in them but use them for walking or casual wear. Asics have always been my go-to shoe brand.
"asics Not for high insteps! The OPENING was way too small for me, that is the tongue over the instep just wouldn't allow my heel to get in. Maybe if I'd de-laced the shoes, but then what's the point?"
"asics Buying shoes online is always a bit sketchy, but these look and feel nice. Not the best running shoes I've ever owned, but acceptable. I wear a 11.5 men's wide (2E) and the fit is exactly as expected. The laces are cheap looking, and I will probably end up replacing them quickly. Otherwise, very satisfied."
asics Very light weight but nowhere near the full cushion support of my Nike Vomero... but they were less than 1/2 the cost. They are great for walking in... logged 25 miles in them the first week.
"asics I really like this Asics sneaker, very comfortable fit! This is my second pair( different color) , I paid more at a shoe store,then purchased my second pair from Amazon for less money- about $12.00 ."
"asics Been battling planter fisciitis for 6 months and been trying to find a shoe that feels great. This is it. Have tried a lot of shoes. For the price and quality of the shoe you cannot go wrong. Order half size up. I wear 10 but had to get a 10.5 in this shoe. Feels great, fits perfect. Solid arch support and heel protection."
"asics For the price, this is the best shoe I've ever owned. I like them so much I bought a second pair. The shoes hold up very well as I still wear my first pair, going on 3 years now. I mainly wear them for work and when I take my dog outside. I'll keep buying this shoe when my other two pairs break down. I would probably spend a little more on a shoe for running but for everyday and work I cannot recommended this shoe enough! I like the breathable mesh and how the shoe has enough room for me to add a double foam insert if I want."
"asics These shoes have some style and a lot of comfort. I wish they had some other colors in my size, will purchase when they become available.I wear a 13 4E and would recommend this product for purchase."
"asics Replaced a pair of Asics I've used for running for around 5 years. Got well over 2000 miles out of my old pair, so figured why not try Asics again. Boy, am I glad I did. These shoes fit very well, allow your feet to breathe, and the gel insoles make running long distance on pavement or whatever surface very comfortable. Great choice of styles and colors. I do a lot of running on city streets will uneven sidewalks and railroad tracks. These shoes provide great support and stabilization. I won't go another 5 years without buying another Asics running show."
asics Saw these in a store overpriced and tried them on. Immediately bought them on Amazon. Took a bit to break in as most sneakers do but they are my daily non-work shoe and I am happy with them.
"asics Bought these assuming they would be similar to my newbalance that have always been my go to shoe. They are not. They are much better. Apparently NB has fallen off over the years and the gradual decline, I hadn't noticed. These shoes fit a little tighter in the heel area than I anticipated but give better stability because of it and I'm sure will break in perfect. The toe box fits perfect. Amazon had a sizing calculator recommend a 12.5 in this show as comparable to a 13 in the newbalance. These Asics have a comfy, pillowy feel on the inside but seem very sturdy on the outside. Also the laces seem to stay tied, unlike the NB shoes. These would be a solid value at twice the price. I might buy another pair for a rainy day so to speak. Excellent so far."
"asics Still searching for the perfect work shoe.  This one will be okay for shopping and general wear, but fit not quite right for being on my feet all night at work.  I am going to try the 13s."
"asics Great shoes; gel insert works well to cushion impact of extreme workouts.  I bought a similar pair of ASICS a few years ago, and they lasted amazingly well after hundreds of days of use per year @ my gym."
"asics Excellent shoe! I ordered a half size over my normal size, and they feel absolutely wonderful. One of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, and I dig the color. I had never worn an Asics shoe until 3 years ago, but now I'm a believer in their quality and comfort."
asics Love these shoes!  I'm going to buy a few more pair just in case ASICS discontinues the brand I like again.  I'm not a long distance runner...more like a sprinter...but I love these.  They are perfect.
asics We have searched high and low for a comfortable yet affordable option for my husbands clown feet. These little gems were the solution. We will purchase these again in the future I'm sure.
asics Fit was perfect. The company delivered the shoes very fast. The only thing I can say that is negative is the shoes in the picture looks black but the shoes that were delivered were more of a dark grey.
"asics Bought this because my Nike Freerunner's make my feet hurt after runs that are longer than 6 miles. I wore this to train for the SF Half Marathon, and my feet have never been happier for it. I had no feet issues training for the race (2 short runs ~4 mi and 1 long run ~10 mi per week)<br/><br/>They're bulkier and maybe uglier than other light-weight running shoes, but they're definitely more supportive."
"asics So far so good- still on the break in period. I ordered them 1/2 size larger than my normal size and are just right.<br/>The laces do seem to be a bit short, makes it a little difficult to get it tied securely for distance running."
"asics Wow. I don't think I've ever come across a shoe this nice. Extremely sturdy and durable exterior with insane tread. And super comfy, non restrictive interior. Doesn't make my feet sweat either. Highly recommend."
"asics never shopping for running shoes again, here i get my size and color no problem, good shoes good price these days for chinese crap we are forced to buy in this planned obsolescence world"
asics I bought these to trail run in and what I found is they hurt going down hills. Also they feel like they absorb less impact then my previous pair. A little disappointing but they work well as walking shoes. So if you are hiking its not a bad pair of sneakers.
"asics We purchased 2 pairs of these shoes!  My husband had a pair of the same shoes that he loved but completely wore out.  At size 14, if you find a shoe that fits we thought it best to buy more!"
"asics Best sneaker I've bought. I wanted something light, can be used for running or general activities, looks good, and could be used on some more rugged terrains.  This fit the bill exactly."
"asics Generally, I love ASICS (yes, for me, not him). I have painful plantar faciitis, and must use good quality shoes with good arches. I've had to glue this one back AGAIN. First, it was the pad that kept working it's way up, so I glued it down. Next, the bottom of the shoe quite literally detached from the rest of it. Both on right foot. Anyway, the glue has cured, and hopefully, I won't need to glue anything else. I would take off only one star for Reebok, but I pay more for ASICS and think I have the right to expect more (which I usually do get!)"
asics So far have put about 50 miles on wooded trails in WA.  Toe box is good at protection - no broken toenails or bruises.  Stability is also good on uneven terrain.  Comfort level is also good - no shin or foot issues.  Haven't taken them in a stream yet so can't comment on water drainage.  Very pleased so far.
"asics Better than the Converse I've been wearing; and, same price, delivered.  +'s are arch support, heel support, great traction, tough shoe that holds up on ladders, roofs, and Ozark chert rocks. I like the pull loop to get your heel into the shoe. The shoe strings are heavy duty cord.  These shoes have held up to a month of abuse in my painting business and they look flawless, except for a few paint drips."
"asics For the money, Asics really created a great shoe. I know there are better products made by ASICS, but this is about as good as it gets for the price. You could easily spend double and only get 10% better. For me, the shoe fits as expected and has a wonderful ride. It has support, doesn't get overly hot, and seems to take a beating.<br/><br/>This is a remake of an old design I purchased several years ago. I can say I still have my old pair for yard work and such, still providing support, still holding up.<br/><br/>Honestly, this is ASICS affordable shoe and it does deserve the ASICS name."
"asics Surprisingly, exactly what I wanted from ordering almost blindly from Amazon. The 13 extra wides fit wonderfully and comfortably, and they aren't brightly overmolded so I can wear them to work."
"asics The shoe has everything one expects from a Trail Running Shoe.  Once you wear the shoe for a few days, it conforms to your foot.  One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned!!"
asics Shoes fit true to size 14. They feel a little stiff initially but may loosen up as they are used. All the running shoes I've had in the past like NB seemed a little more comfortable in its new stage.
"asics Shoe is a little hot, especially for south Florida, but fits great and is comfortable. I am suffering from plantar fascitis and these Asics were recommended. They have helped greatly, although I don't wear them every day."
"asics I returned the first pair I ordered because they were SO DARK and replaced them for this product color based on the image showing mostly white. This shoe was marginally lighter in color than the pair that was too Dark. Apparently a WHITE or mostly white Asics running show is no longer available. They are fine for yard work, but look terrible in any pair of shorts ... as the dark color looks makes them look a dress shoe. I would never wear these out in public unless I was wearing a dark outfit. Disappointed by the unavailability of the White Asics color that I have been buying for years."
asics I love these shoes.  I bought them because I donated my last trail running shoes at Warrior Dash.  I used them recently for another obstacle course race and they held out fine. Very comfortable.
asics They have enough room for a corrective arch support. I've worn nothing but Asics for 27 years. I can count on them to fit every time. They wear like iron even though I treat them badly.
"asics I had originally bought the Nike Air Pegasus and they were light and comfortable, but barely any support and they got destroyed within 4 months of running on road/trail. While using the Nike Air Pegasus I also got knee pain in my left knee preventing me from running long and thought I had a serious injury. I bought these shoes not thinking they would really help, to my surprise they are amazingly sturdy something I would not expect from a $60 shoe. First day running in them my knee pain was almost completely GONE. After running 2 miles on trail had no pain whatsoever. I've heard a lot of good things about Asics thank goodness I bought these."
"asics These were my 3rd and 4th pair of ASICS shoes. I love them. Great for running, working out in or just wearing with a pair of jeans or casual slacks. I usually rotate wearing the two pairs."
asics Most new shoes are wonderful at first. But these really good up to the beatings. Would certainly buy again. Colors are slightly darker than expected. But over all shoe performs well
"asics Fit perfect and love these for running and working out. great price at $55 I would buy again at that price, if the price went up, I'd look elsewhere though, not a premium model shoe"
"asics Great running shoe. I have always been a big fan of ASICS running shoes and this new one did not disappoint. Great fit and comfort while I run my 4 mile morning run, and they look really sharp too."
asics Awesome shoes. Breath yet relativaley water resistant. I was recommended to these shoes by my doctor after I broke my foot pretty spectacularly and they have been one of the best shoe buys I've made.
"asics From experience and feedback I've heard about Asics in general, I ordered a half size larger than normal.  Good choice, and these fit perfectly.  I love this shoe so much that this is actually the second pair I've ordered recently."
asics Hey I'll make this short and to the point. These are great shoes for moderate use. I run every week or so and also use these for my daily wear.<br/><br/>They fit as expected and seem to have decent cushion. The price made me buy these. They seem to be a good deal for $45.<br/><br/>They provide decent support while I run. I am only running a couple miles at a time so I do not know how they would do for 3 miles or longer.<br/><br/>Overall seems to be a pretty good show for the price.<br/><br/>Please say my review was helpful if you enjoyed.
"asics My son loves his new shoes... I love them for the quality construction and support for my sons growing feet, and they last a lot longer than a lot of other cheaper shoes out there."
asics Its a little early to really review these because I have had them for just a short time; but they are comfortable and fit true to size. Hopefully they will hold up in the long run.
asics Great shoe!!! Got these for the hubs for Fathers Day and he loves them!<br/>He has a bad knee and he said that this shoe gives me a lot of support and his knee doesn't hurt as bad.
"asics I don't like taking the time to type up reviews when I'm not getting paid; but these shoes are a great deal for the asking price.  A few other reviews I read before buying them suggested they are a firm padding, not very soft.  That's accurate.  But since I've broken them in, they offer pretty good impact resistance and they have just become more comfortable to wear.  And they look better than I expected.  Normally when I spend under 100 bucks for a pair of shoes I usually don't like them.  These are quality shoes."
"asics I'm very happy with these great shoes that I use for walking a few miles  to/from work and at the gym. I added some gel insoles to make them a little more shock absorbent due to a pinched nerve in my spine that I have to watch out for.  But at $44 I was happy to spend a few more bucks to make them truly perfect for my needs. One note, if you're going to add gel insoles underneath the insole that comes with the shoe, then you should get 1/2 size larger for a perfect fit."
"asics I am stuck on these shoes.  My last three pairs of athletic shoes have been this model.<br/>The size and width are accurate.  The padding and arch support are exactly what I need to allow me to run and jog through the pain of chronic plantar fasciitis in both feet.<br/>The lace configuration allows me to tighten sufficiently to avoid blistering movement with no restriction blood flow to my feet.<br/>They are durable as well.  They remain comfortable past the time that most athletic shoes have developed holes in the soles.<br/>Overall, it's an excellent shoe.  I'm wearing them now."
"asics This is a comfortable walking shoe with good support.  I walk mainly on gravel, and this shoe works well in that capacity.<br/><br/>I ordered my normal size (10.5), and had to return them for a larger size (11EEE), which fits perfectly.  I don't normally wear a wide shoe, but that was what was available at the time, and they fit perfectly, so these may run a little narrow also."
"asics Exactly what I wanted for daily walks in the city. V comfortable, light and not too flashy (in silver/grey).  Quality seems good and I love the Square section laces - nice touch."
asics The best praise for a running shoe is that you don't even think about it.Fits perfectly cushions the feet. Reasonably price. Not sure u can do much better than this and certainly not for the price
asics After wearing a pair of Gel Venture until they had holes in the insole I figured it was time to replace them.  Unfortunately they have discontinued the model I had and replaced them with this new model. I was sure that these would be every bit as good but unfortunately they are lacking in several ways.  I've worn them for a couple months now and they are still just as hard and uncomfortable to walk on as the day I got them.  I hate throwing away money but these will have to be replaced long before they see the mileage that asics are known for getting.
asics It hasn't even been three months and the stitching is coming apart near my toe.  I hear there's a difference between mine made in Vietnam and USA made so I'm  looking into that
"asics Absolutely love these shoes. You may think that they are a little tight at first, but definitely with this style you will want to get your exact size as it will stretch as you wear them. I think I am going to buy a second pair to have has a backup just in case this style goes out as they always change and suddenly no longer become available."
"asics Happy with purchase. Was looking at sneakers that were much more expensive but decided to try these. Bought a 1/2 size larger and they fit perfect, they run about the same size as Nike which also run somewhat small. Will see how they hold up over time. If they hold up well will defiantly buy again."
"asics These shoes are uber comfy. I wish other companies made extra wide shoes. Not everyone has skinny feet, as stupid as that sounds. They grip the surface of my gym floor and thereby offer additional traction. The support is a welcome change from my old gym shoes, which were falling apart btw. Even my trainer said I needed new shoes. In my time of need I turned to ASICS. They did not disapoint."
"asics Value: Excellent<br/>Quality: Good<br/>Comments: This is a great shoe for someone with wide, large, or hard-to-fit feet. The inside wears out faster than I'd like (particularly in the back), but this is from an average of about 3 months of daily wear. I have found that this is pretty standard for Asics that are used heavily, as several family members have had them. The plastic that forms the heel tends to rip a hole through the fabric and poke through it. Maybe this is something the company could work to improve. Overall, though, I'm a happy customer. Price was very reasonable."
"asics Rarely, do I order a pair of anything on line and my husband slips them on and voila he is satisfied with the quality, fit, and he is wearing them daily.<br/>Thank you for you quick service and great pricing!"
"asics Great running shoe - my son over pronates when he walks, and the doctor recommended that we always purchase ASICS for him because they offer great stability and arch support."
asics I have previously bought Brooks running shoes but they are so expensive and was trying something new. I have a hard time trying to find good running shoes that run wide and these fit very well.  The biggest issue I had was they seemed to wear out rather quickly and the heel of the shoe is already worn out after about 200+ miles whereas my Brooks still hold together well past 300+ miles. I don't think I am an overly aggressive runner but I am a little surprised they broke down already.
"asics When I lace these up, it makes me feel almost not fat!  But seriously, these are great for walking around or light running.  The treads would be perhaps too smooth for rough trail running, but for a regular knocking around/gym/dog walking shoe, this is just the ticket."
"asics Love these shoes! First found them in a mall while on a trip to the Smokey Mountains in Tennessee and these shoes were wonderful. Most comfortable and supportive I have ever owned. So when they wore out, I knew I had to try them again, and I have not been disappointed!"
asics Read someone else review is as they say size fit perfect I wear  10.5 and im glad they are not wide just a perfect fit as if I walk in the store and tried them on.
"asics Decent shoe however it started to sqeak after about 10-15 uses and now they aren't my favorite shoe to wear. Still pretty comfortable though, however I usually reach for the Merrell Grassbow Air Trail's instead."
asics I've been on my fourth trail run now totaling about 26 miles and these shoes are very comfortable and at a great price.  I think I'll buy a couple more pairs if they are still available.
"asics These shoes are great for running and hiking. They run a little small for me: I am generally a size 9 for most shoes but for these I needed a 9.5. The bottom of the shoe is made of a harder material than most shoes, you can definitely feel the difference if you compare it to another running shoe. I like to use them for hiking and running on the pavement, so having the bottom a little harder is great. However, if you are looking for shoes to casually job in or go on the treadmill with, these may not be for you."
"asics I finally git my husband in the gym! He's really liking the feel of this shoe. We did change out the insole for one with more heel and arch support. So far, they're holding up well!"
asics So far they have been great. They are comfortable and wide enough for my foot issues. I am a diabetic so a good fit is really important and I have had surgery on my feet. I have walked up to 5 miles a day in them with no problems.
"asics I've been through 10-12 pairs of Asic in the pasts.  Within the last few years my GF would buy me a competitor brand for gifts so I had to wear them.  Also, In the last year I started to experience a large amount of heel/arch/ankle pain.  I think these AD!D*S have messed up my feet.<br/>One week back on asics and my foot pain is receding...  I walk about 15,000-20,000 steps a day inside on a theater stage and in ballrooms. Love this brand!!"
asics I had to return the first pair as it was too big. I ordered another pair 1/2 size smaller which fit me just fine. ASICS apparently uses shoe sizes that are slightly larger than normal US sizes.
"asics These are great. My. 5th pair of ASICs. I ordered i1 size large then my every day shoe size, I have high arches and pronate My daughter is a nurse and found her Nikes wear out quickly and now wears ASICs"
"asics In one asics an 11 fits, in another it's too big in another too small.  Year to year the models change and so do the sizes with the models.  I can't keep up. I've had it.."
"asics Updated:  I still wear them, because they are comfortable.  However, within 6 months the stitching came out of the little flap over the center of the toe of both shoes, and I had to cut the string and work it back so that it wouldn't come out further.  I stopped wearing them as frequently because of that.  After a year, they still looked ok, but the stitching started to come out of the leather around the front of the shoe.  I am pretty sure that I did not wear them enough to have stitching come out, so I removed a star from my review.  Typically with other brands, my experience has been that the sole wears away before the shoe comes apart and I have to toss them.<br/><br/>Otherwise, very comfortable and good for both active and casual wear."
"asics I've only worn these once since they arrived (I wear dress shoes to work and don't wear shoes around the house) but I found them to be a nice snug fit (which is how *I* like shoes like this to fit), VERY comfortable when walking and very lightweight on the foot.<br/><br/>I can feel the aggressive tread, which I like. I actually bought these because my current sneakers/running shoe are fine but a little beat up. I'm going to Hawaii in September and wanted something like this for hiking up Diamondhead and around town. I will add on after I get back but I'm very happy so far."
"asics While the shoe is good quality it unfortunately was not the shoe for me. The quality is what I expected from an Asics and the price was quite good. The fit was not correct for my foot, causing some discomfort in my heel after two-to-three weeks of use. I would endorse the purchase of this shoe for those who have a C-D width foot and an average foot shape. If you are a B-C width, consider an Asics that comes in widths (Narrow) or another brand that fits slimmer. Overall, very good quality but not quite the right shoe for me."
asics This was by far my best amazon find! These are not easy to find in stores in size 14 but they were here! Boyfriend works at GM and these are by far the best shoes for being on your feet! Will buy this again for sure!
"asics The arch supports are about an inch too far forward and instead of supporting my arch, they just give me insane blood blisters on the inside of the balls of my feet after just five miles of asphalt pounding.  I've put somewhere between 50-100 miles on them already, so they should be reasonably broken in, but they're still killing my feet like none other.  I regret buying these shoes....  I guess running shoes are something you really should goto a store for."
"asics No issues, would buy again."
"asics other than my nike pegasis 30's that i got 2.5 years ago, these shoes are the best. dunno how well they'll wear, but likely not as well as the nikes that i'm still using."
asics Asics are a great shoe. They are fairly consistent with their fit and last a good while. I wear these shoes everyday and they last a good few months before they wear out.
"asics Once you find something that works, keep it. This is a great running shoe. I order a new pair when the current one starts to wear out. I think I'm on my fourth pair now."
asics Small in width and length.
"asics So far so good.  It's pretty small,  so I can only do one hand/foot at a time,  but for the low cost,  it's worth it to me to take a few extra minutes doing one at a time.  :)"
"asics I've had better Asics.  The shoe seems to run small, and the heel is large.  Its more like a hiking shoe.  I replaced the flimsy insole with a custom orthotic.  Good value for under $50.00."
asics Asics shoes seem to fit me perfectly with excellent arch support. Shoe is light and comfortable with a rugged sole and non-slip bottom. Definitely would purchase again.
asics this was a gift -- for my father who is 96!  He loves the shoes - and said they were very comfortable.  I ended up buying a 2nd pair (in silver) for him AND a pair for me.<br/><br/>Nice job Asics!!
"asics Super price for this super snikers, I used for running I know my side exatly because I only buy ASICS, they at the bigining didn't feel as cushi as my $89 GEL cumulus but in few days they felt right, and lighter, not I love them."
"asics High quality sneaker for a great price. No complaints.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>after two months of wearing these sneakers, they are already falling apart...very cheap quality"
"asics Nice shoes. They fit pretty well. I haven't gotten to the point where I'm using them for their intended purposes (exercise) yet, but I had very good impressions of them on my first try"
asics I wore a hole into the inside back heel of these in less than a month of wearing them. The amount of padding between the Blk mesh and the heel wall is only a thin lining of grey foam. I'd doubt I'll get anything from Asics but I won't buy this runner/hiking shoe again. Heel padding is inadquate IMO.
"asics Great fit for running, compares well to the newbalance trail running shoes I used before these. Only had it for a week with several runs, hopefully it holds up well."
asics i wear 8.5 wide for Asic or 9 normal.  I usually order GT series and size 9 fits good.  This Gel Venture size 9 actually feels a little tighter.  Returning to Amazon
"asics Perfect fit, they were true to size and a great value. Thank you Asics for the top quality product and thank you Amazon for offering them at a very reasonable price."
"asics Ok I love asic gel sneakers.  This is going to be a shorter review cause the design is all personal preference.  However my feet are extremely comfortable and have been wearing these for YEARS.  So if that says something bout the comfort of these sneakers, I'm not sure what else is.  The price is fantastic.  I was even tempted to order a second pair just to save.  Have to say if I can give this product more then a 5 star review I definitely would.  Asics are the best sneakers for every day use.  I'm not a runner, but I am on my feet all day and my feet are saying THANK YOU ."
asics Shoes delivered as promised and in new condition. The fit was as expected. I am using these for morning walks and am very pleased. I would recommend these to a friend.
"asics Offers nice support, the shoes are very comfortable.  Size just right. Delivery was very quick. Packaging was appropriate.<br/><br/>Recommended for routine wear."
"asics These Asics run small, in both width and length. I have currently 7 other pairs of Asics all 14D, which is my size. These are also 14D, but when I tried them on, they were tight in the toe box, across the balls of the feet and in the length. I hand compared them to my other Asics shoes and, sure enough, they were about a half inch shorter and an half inch narrower. They are a nice looking shoe but looks don't count in comparison to fit, especially for me since I walk more than one hour each day, 365 days a year."
"asics Just received today and they run a little bit large so I am going to have to buy thicker socks but can't to get outside tomorrow,right now I would give the fit a 3.5."
asics Comfortable.  Only complaint is that they provide very little traction on a smooth surface like glazed clay tile.  Zero traction if the surface is smooth and wet.
asics I had this style and size that I had gotten from an outlet store. Ordered same model/size and fit perfectly and I didn't have to drive the 30 miles to the outlet.
asics I like these shoes and wear them everyday... very good to my feet...they seem to wear out quickly I get around 3 mo.  Saying that I walk between 70000 and 90000 steps a week per my Fitbit
"asics I was a little skeptical about these shoes being as comfortable as my last pair of Asics, which were over one hundred dollars, but so far so good. I primarily use these as workout shoes for cardio on a treadmill or outdoor walking and they are as comfortable as my last pair. I have wide feet, and most shoes I just have to ""break into"" but these fit great right out of the box. The back heel area of my last pair of Asics were shredded after about two years of use, so we'll see if this is the same with these. If they last me a year I'll be happy."
asics I originally bought a black pair and they quickly became my favorite shoes.  I bought these and another color.  The fit is consistent between the different pairs.
asics Running shoes can be expensive this is a great pair when starting to run. Probably won't last for the extreme runner but would work great for the average runner.
"asics This is a two (2) part review:  I have had these shoes for a little over three (3) months when I began to experience rubbing behind the heal, almost to the point I could not wear the shoes.  I noticed that the material above and behind the heal had worn through.  I am attempting to repair with duct tape.  I truly thought I had a shoe brand I could go to, but then my ASICS tennis shoes gave me the worst heal bruise.  I have been forced to take time off from tennis and see a podiatrist.  No more ASICS for me!"
"asics I ordered the Asics Venture running shoes in 4E.  These Asics look good, as advertised.  Previously I always wore standard width Asics, however since retiring I've mostly worn sandals, and my toes now hate being restricted.  The 4E width satisfies the width issue but the top of the shoe is still a little too snug to be worn for more then 6 hours.  So far, I've walked about 12-15 km, on paved and crushed stone paths /roads, in these Asisc.  I'm still breaking them in.  This week I will replace the factory laces with bungee type laces, to improve comfort."
asics I use it for work daily and they hold up great for my 15hr shifts. They let my feet breath and are very ligh so i won't get tire. Recommend and will buy again.
"asics I've had several pairs of Asics, the others were a little more expensive than these. The look and feel of these are very similar to the more expensive ones I've had and they feel very comfortable."
"asics Needed a new pair of shoes for work. I work in IT as user support so I am on my feet for a good portion of my 8 hour days. These shoes checked all the boxes that I felt were important. They were not crazy colors, which seems harder and harder to find. They were relatively inexpensive, and so far have been comfortable for the entire day. I am very pleased with these shoes and would not hesitate to buy them again."
asics Length is right but width is a bit tight. Should fit better after a while of wearing in. I wear a size 11 with medium width. Get 1 width bigger. Nice quality.
"asics A little narrow. Heel cup area is a little hard. Took over a week to break in without blisters.<br/>**I'm revising this review. After trying to run in these shoes for over a month, the heel cup completely wore through. Blisters on my heel constantly! I've taped my heels, inserted cushions and tried just about everything else. These are terrible shoes and I would not recommend them to anyone. #completelydisgusted"
"asics Great value.  I've had problem with a severe strain on my toe which has taken months to heal with my old shoes.  I've been wearing these for a month and my toe is healing thanks to the great support the shoe provides.  The only negative comment is that they seem to take on odors easier than other shoes I have owned.  I don't normally have a problem with foot odor, but I got them wet and they smelled like wet dog immediately.  After hand washing and drying in the sun, the odor was gone but it comes back if they get damp.  I store them close to damp rid and it prevents further odor.  I think it's the material that makes them smell bad when damp or wet."
"asics I like them so far. I have given 4 stars because I just got the shoes and have worn them about 5 times. These shoes are very comfortable and offer good support. I haven't used them for exercise yet as my running shoes are not worn out yet. They look great, appear to be built well and are very comfortable. The size was the same as all other shoes I wear including Avia, adidas, cheap Walmart shoes, Danner boots...pretty much all but newbalance which I wear a half size up in those."
"asics Nice looking shoe, but it's a tight fit even though I ordered the 4 e wide.  10.5 length is fine just a bit more narrow than I like. Insoles are very thin I think they could be more cushioning."
"asics Bought these for a grandson who was starting a training program requiring running shoes. I hit the trifecta: he liked the style, fit well, and are comfortable."
"asics These shoes were not of the quality of my previous Asics trail running shoes. After 4 months of hiking with them and wearing them on a regular basis, they have begun to fall apart as the sole is separating from the shoe. I've always had good experiences with my Asics until this shoe. I'm hoping this is a one time quality failure."
asics So far so good. Asics have been very good to me and I buy about 4 pairs of athletic sneakers a year. Size 13 fit as expected (same size with newbalance).
"asics It feels a bit heavier than other Asics shoes I have. I have not tried them in a running situation, but it feels pretty sturdy and comfortable. Should be fine... I'll update if it doesn't."
asics These shoes were a gift for my brother-in-law.  I purchased the updated model of the Asics men's running shoes he had--and wore daily.  This version fits him perfectly; transition from old pair to new pair accomplished without pain.
"asics love these shoes!  Took about 2 days to break them in...now that they have been broken in, they are extremely comfortable and feel like I'm walking on air."
"asics I was looking for athletic shoes to wear with my beige, tan, and olive clothes and could not find any in women's models so I turned to the men's section and found these, which are perfect.  Asics tend to run a little small so I ordered accordingly.  They fit well and provide excellent arch support and cushioning."
"asics I like Asics.  I use to do newbalance, but I found the Asics fit me better.  The problem I have is finding the wider widths, but that isn't an issue on Amazon.  I bought the shoe.  It arrived quickly,  I love the fit/feeling.  Done deal.<br/><br/>If I had to complain about anything, then it'd be breathability/odor.  However, I'm not sure if that's the shoes fault or my body/foot's fault, so I can't really hold that against this shoe.  A little talc or foot spray solves it though, so no worries."
"asics I bought my first pair of ASICS gel venture 3 shoes 4 years ago.  I have wide feet and finding truly comfortable shoes is time consuming.  After trying on shoes for over an hour I picked the ASICS.  When they wore out I bought another pair on Amazon.  I just plugged in the numbers off of my existing shoes and voila!  Same shoes, perfect fit!  This time around I couldn't find the same shoes on Amazon, but these Venture 5s were recommended so I ordered them.  Same great comfort and fit!  Thx Amazon!"
asics Not the best running shoe. Its a good everyday shoe. They squeaked for quite a while. The sole basically seems like a foam. I wouldn't recommend as a running shoe.
"asics I try to run at least 3 miles once a week at minimum, and 3 times a week on average; and these shoes serve as my everyday walking around shoe. They fit perfectly and perform very well for such a modest price. Also, I big around big around the waist and these shoes support my weight in a comfortable fashion."
"asics It's ok for walking.  Not good for running.  Hits too hard, doesn't cushion the blow at all.  Seems durable though, so 3 stars for durability and low price.  I think I paid $40, but I returned them."
asics Great support and grip on various surfaces. Makes me a bit more energetic and willing to walk further and faster. It's not a chore if it feels this good.
asics I find these shoes as comfortable as a $160 pair of another brand. I intended this purchase to replace an old pair that I used for everyday use but find these ASICS are in competition with my expensive shoes to wear when I walk. I am very happy with my purchase.
asics Length is right but shoe is way too narrow. Keep waiting for these to stretch out but they don't. Not comfortable after short use. Wouldn't buy again.
"asics If you are looking for a lightweight shoe for heavy walkers/runners and you have flat feet/some issues with over-pronation, then this is a good shoe. It provides the durability and stability needed. The only concern is the sole and cushioning around the ankle are a little stiff, but that's part of the stability portion. It also adds to the shoe's durability since these are intended for trails."
"asics Because Sacouny (sp?) has all but discontinued the Hurricanes, I needed a new shoe.  I'm a middle distance jogger/runner of 13.1 and Sprint to Olympic TRIs.  100 miles in and good to go."
"asics Figured I'd pitch in with the review. 9 months, going strong. No wear or tear, and I've really abused these. Probably the best shoes I've ever bought."
"asics Light weight, comfortable, well built shoe. I wore them on a long car ride across several states with great results. I didn't even have to break them in. Fit as expected"
asics Good fitting shoe that look great. Worked out in them and ran several miles and have had no issues so far. Others have complained about the glue coming off of the front or whatever. Just buy some glue/adhesive from a local store and fix it for several dollars if that happens.<br/><br/>So far so good!
"asics Thought they sent the wrong size til I looked inside the box, the label on the box covered the correct size.  I have some of these shoes.  I wanted another pair.  Great shoe for me."
asics The title should say it all. I have not in my entire life found such a perfect pair of outdoor running sneakers.<br/><br/>note that these are best for people with a slightly taller arch.
"asics I have flat feet and these were recommended to me by several people.  With an arch insert, they are super comfortable.  Would definitely buy again."
asics Very comfortable sneakers. I have no cartilage in either knee and the meniscus is torn in both knees. These sneakers make walking much more comfortable.
asics I just keep reordering these in different colors and they do what you would ask a shoe to do. Saves me from wasting an hour at Ross and each pair fits regardless of the style. The best part is the extra wide sizes my foot is a whooping Size 11US 4E
"asics I love these shoes, I have very wide feet for a woman so I end up buying men's tennis shoes.  I have bunions and instead of getting surgery (which I've heard negative things about from several people that got the surgery, including a podiatrist!) I've opted to just get more wide, comfortable shoes.  I've been through A LOT of tennis shoes, I used to buy newbalance but my last pair didn't hold up well, so I decided to try some that were less expensive.  These are very lightweight and comfortable. I would purchase them again."
"asics Hey! Give me some time to work them in and check out the quality of materials and workmanship. At less than one week, I'd say they measure up well."
asics I love my new Asics. Some brands run a little big or small but the size in these was absolutely on point. I am just getting over a broken foot and these are giving me exactly the support I need. I am completely satisfied!!
asics Trail running shoe for regular runner who wants arch and foot support and good cushioning. Also look good for wearing with jeans.
"asics I bought these shoes because I have Plantar Fasciiatis  and I can change the shoe insert for the one recommended by my Podiatrist.  Very comfortable,  they fit like a pair of gloves. A little bit slippery on wet tile. I haven't tried them running long distance because Im just coming back to running and I'm taking it easy.<br/>Update. I got a secon pair of these shoes. One for work and another one for running.I started running again, trying to get ready for a 5K. No Plantar Faciiatis, but apparently these shoes have poor  ventilation and they get very smelly. I had never had that problem before."
"asics I have plantar fasciitis. I'm a big man. 6'3"" at 300 pounds. Absolutely love these shoes. Extremely comfortable. Can walk all day with no pain."
"asics Love these shoes! I had to return the first order which was a size 11, it was tight, Amazon shipped me a pair size 11.5 right away and they fit just great!"
"asics It gets two stars only because they're comfortable, but I'll be surprised if they last another 6 months. In less than a month the rubber started separating from the bottom of the shoe and that's with casual wear, I imagine they'd be in much worse shape if I were doing any kind of exercise in them.."
asics I'm on my feet all day on hard concrete and they're very comfortable
"asics I really enjoy the line of road running shoes that asics makes, so hopefully these trail runners will perform adequately as well. They certainly fit nicely and are comfortable to wear."
asics I purchased a 9.5 because that's my shoe size and they fit as expected. The heel has noticeable cushioning when walking fast and joggingmaling these comfortable to exercise in. This is my first pair of Asics and I would purchase again.
"asics It's a great shoe, but they stink after a while. I've never had a shoe stink this much, I always were sock and keep my feet clean but these shoes must have a airflow problem because my feet get very hot and stinky at the end of the day."
"asics Wow, is all I can say about these kicks!  I used Amazon's little ""fitting guide"" to get the right size for me.  My old shoes were a pair of Brooks and I put what size they were in their guided template.  I had the Brooks shoes fitted at a running shoe store.  These new Asics fit perfectly, and feel more supportive and comfortable than the Brooks did.  The Brooks cost me over $110, and these are much cheaper.  Can say much to the durability right now, but out of the box these shoes can be wore all day.  Can wait to put them through the ringer!<br/><br/>Great buy!"
"asics Looked good, but was too small for my orthotics"
"asics These are okay.  They have held up well, I just don't find them particularly comfortable.  The ""wide"" is not very wide in my opinion."
"asics This is a nice sneaker but too heavy. My son used them for track and complained that they were too heavy for him to wear, so we returned them."
asics I've always been partial to ASICS shoes and this one didn't disappoint. I'm not a trail runner but I wanted a shoe with a more aggressive tread than a standard running shoe. I also wanted a shoe that was at least a little less likely to show dirt and the colors of this one seemed perfect to me.
asics Good show very comfortable only bad part is the shoe laces always come untied I have several pair of the same shoe because they are that good
asics One of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned! The size was right on and quality is good. This is an excellent shoe especially for this price and I will definitely buy it again!
"asics Fit is good, comfortable. I  was nervous orderingredients off line cause shoes fit so different  but I  took  the gamble on  these and lucked out, now I'm  hoping they last the ytfi of the year."
"asics First of all, I don't run. Like many though, I bought these for everyday use. I have been through several pairs of very comfortable Asics  Kahana's in 11.5 4E (one size larger than my measured size). I tried these Ventures in the same size to save a few bucks. Terribly uncomfortable and the toe box is not as roomy as the Kahana's. I can't wear them for more than a few hours. Unfortunately, I did not realize this until wearing them for a few weeks. I could live with a harder or softer sole than what I expected, but I'm quite disappointed that they fit painfully different in the toe box than the Kanana. I can't wear them for more than a few hours."
"asics I normally wear newbalance or Propet due to having wide feet.  This is my first Asics because i just learned it too was offered in my size, 9 4E.  Unfortunately, It turned out to be a bit snug and a little uncomfortable to wear.  I gave the shoe a 3-star rating as it turned out to be a nice looking shoe and I'm hoping the shoe will loosen up a bit after some use.  I guess I'll begin by using the shoe for shorter periods until the fit improves?  Only time and my feet will tell."
"asics This is my 3 plus pair of shoes I have bought online. Haven't had a problem yet. 6'2, 205 lbs want to be runner. Knees feel good. Run about 9 miles a week."
"asics I was afraid this would fit too small based on reviews, but it's actually a little larger than I expected. I ordered a 9.5 based on my previous pair of Asics Gels that are about 4 years old. I like a little wiggle room in the toe, so these are very comfortable. I haven't tried them on the treadmill or running yet, but hope I can lace them down tightly enough to avoid any problems."
"asics A bit too small, but I guess it will streach enough to be all right (if I do not get the finger out before that). Quality is somehow bad: you can see glue all over, some parts of shoe soles are looking like they will fall appart... It seems like they did not do QC on them or they are 2 or 3 class of shoes. I do not run long miles, so can not tell how  they would feel on long trails, not bad for short runs (up to 5 km). Made in China..."
"asics Had another pair of these that lasted 2 years with over 2000 running miles on them which people say you shouldn't keep running shoes for that long but they've held up so didn't feel like changing them. In fact the only reason I've replaced my old pair is because I've gotten paint all over them.<br/><br/>So yeah used these shoes for everything; hiking, biking, running, tennis, basketball they are like the multitool of shoes. They dry fast and are ultra durable.<br/><br/>Fit was exact, I wear a 9 4E very comfortable. Thank you asics for the wider shoe options."
"asics Great shoes for a good price. Now that I know that they fit accurately, I can order a new pair with confidence when these wear out. Took them on a couple of camping trips and walked a lot of miles and they were very comfortable. Washed them in the washing machine when we got back home and they were fine."
asics Had these about 2 months and they feel comfortable. Would recommend for a $50 shoe. I particularly like the dark green because it goes with a lot.
"asics For the money, these things are great.  I've jogged in them twice so far, definitely a nice shoe.  I can't rate them over time yet though."
asics My husband loves these for travel.  They look good with even dress pants and feel great.  He has foot/heal issues and the gel feels great!
"asics Great shoes for a great price. I walk a lot for my job. 10,000 steps is a slow day. I feel like the arches are already collapsing after just 2 months. Don't know if it's b/c I walk so much or the shoe. Otherwise a great buy."
"asics People if you want a good shoe for hikes and trials and dont want to dish out hundreds of dollars on ""Hiking Shoes"" this is the perfect pair. The grips on these shoes are perfect for non wet surfaces. The inner sole is removal so if you can swap it out and put gel soles like i did. ( I swap all soles of my shoes for my gel ones i didn't even bother trying the sole of this shoe so i dont know if the material is comfortable as i removed it as soon as i got it) Overall very solid pair of shoes. Asics shoes never disappoint me."
asics I bought these for my husband as a replacement of a pair he previously owns. He wears a size 15 and it's difficult to find comfortable shoes that fit well and he loves it!
"asics So far I like these shoes. Of course, the real test will come when I wear them and jog in them. That's when I will know for sure. I will be getting back to you. It will only take this week for me to decide. I really hope they run and wear well.i run this morning and one shoe felt good and the right shoe did not. It doesn't make any sense. But, I think I know the problem and I don't think it's the shoe. Overall, I  like these sneakers."
"asics I bought these recently based on all the great reviews. I am a bigger guy, around 240 lbs usually. These shoes fit me well, they are very sturdy, and very supportive. They look really nice, and the price was great. However, I wouldn't recommend these shoes for running, for 3 reasons.<br/><br/>1) They are not very breathable. If you run for a long time, or run fast, your feet will get damp with these<br/>2) They are heavy. These are noticeably heavy for running shoes, and that can make a big difference in your runs.<br/>3) The treads are great for trail running, but not great for pavement or treadmill surfaces. They are very ""grabby"" and ""spikey"" compared to a more running-focused shoe.<br/><br/>I gave these 3 stars because they are advertised as a running shoe, and for me they don't excel at that purpose. These are not bad shoes, they are just bad for running. They would be great for walking, esp. on dirt paths. They would probably be decent trail running shoes. I recommend for the same price you pick up Asics Gel Contend 3 shoes, great shoes for the same price. They are lighter and more breathable, and still durable enough."
"asics Cheaper than department stores, I know what size I wear in Asics so they fit perfectly. Added bonus, the soles don't have any defective lumps in them as I've found when going to Payless or similar bargain shoe stores. I will definitely be purchasing my shoes online from now on."
"asics These shoes are wonderful.  I had a pair of ""Gel Venture 4"" shoes that lasted over a year when I wore them daily.  The ""Gel Venture 5"" shoes seem to be every bit as good, if not better."
"asics toe box is small.  was hoping the wear in process would give me a more comfortable fit.  but no, not fitting any better after a couple weeks."
asics Extremely comfortable and well made. Finding extra wide athletic shoes in stores in becoming harder for me so these fit the bill just fine
"asics I used the Asics Gel Venture 5 shoes for walking, hiking, and running for six days on my very recent summer vacation trip.  I am satisfied with its performance and design.  I did not see anything wrong with the shoes yet."
"asics Decent all around running shoe.  Not the super lightweight type you would get at a professional running store, but these are much more affordable."
"asics Been about 1.5 years, with moderate use (few 8-10 mile hikes per month). They have held up well. The only noticeable sign of wear is the rubber toe protectors, which have started to peel. But perhaps to be expected given that I'm not especially easy on them.<br/><br/>The mesh upper allows for ventilation and quick drying. These have been completely submerged and were dry only a few hours later (it was a warm summer day, though)."
asics Great shoe that is comfortable and fits as expected. I wear them when doing yard work. I'll be happy if I can get 1 year of use out of them.
asics Was too narrow for my wide foot?  I thought I bought the wide width for these and they were still narrow.  I moved back to newbalance.
"asics So far. So great. Nothing fancy here. Good shoe for the price. It is a regular walking shoe that is duralble enough for work, which includes walking on my feet all day."
"asics Good, comfortable  shoes for the price ... I have 3 pair. Use them for casual wear, working out, and playing golf (I'm an avid golfer with bad feet) I've got a hammer toe on my left foot, so I get then 1/2"" longer and they work fine for me."
asics Great running shoes for the money. I have several hundred miles on my older generation Venture 4 and expect to get the same out of the Venture 5s. They look identical except for a slight variation in the colors.
"asics Everything is great about these shoes; light weight, comfortable, fit as expected, looks great.<br/><br/>The problem is not with the shoes. It's the catalog. Just wish the color in the pictures represent what it is in reality. I returned the first pair for disappointment in the color. So much different than in the picture."
"asics These are very comfortable shoes.  I heard they were good for plantar fasciitis and I have not felt any pain while wearing them.  They are light and make great weekend shoes.  One caution - I bought them for work and while they are comfortable enough, they were too slippery to wear for daily use on wet concrete.  I had to buy something with a non slip sole for that."
"asics Great shoes! I use them at the gym, walking around the city, mountain hiking, and jogging around the block. The insoles wear out pretty quickly, but that might just be me. The soles of the shoes though are tough and last a long time."
asics I am an 11 1/2 not 11 and not 12 ...perfect fit !! I wear them in the gym and I know about ASICS quality from my running days. Great product  and great fit and finish... proud to wear them.
"asics I am an over-pronating long distance trail runner and resorted to Asics after a lot of research. They offer good traction for dirt hills. I have always found them to be rather rigid for my minimalist running style but this was the support I needed. I purchased Powerstep insoles¬†<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Powerstep-Original-Orthotics-Insole-Blue-Black-Men-s-8-8-5-Women-s-10-10-5/dp/B000V0BKDK"">Powerstep Original Orthotics Insole, Blue/Black, Men's 8-8.5, Women's 10-10.5</a>¬†and they fit snugly (I am a size 11). Overall happy with the purchase and they fit as expected."
"asics Asics are great shoes, but no matter how wide I order them, they are too narrow.  I'm a 8 E but I purposely ordered 8 EEEE, and they were STILL to narrow.  BE careful ordering width."
asics Shoe is a bit tight for a trail running shoe. I have another brand of running shoe (Nike) in the same exact size and they fit much better.
"asics Asics shoes have always been great to me! I know everyone is different but since I wear them for work, working out, and daily wear. I wear asics at least 15 hrs a day! These shoes are great at work because I wear them for 12 without issue and they have excellent shock absorption that I'll need for hiking! They are the best looking shoe compared to my Training shoes but I wear them for comfort! I suggest this shoe to anyone. However, go to a store that sells asics and try on a pair first because I am normally a 12 but I only buy asics in 11.5!"
"asics Great shoes, but after a couple months the soles began squeaking on both of them. Added a little bit of cornstarch under the sole liners and most of the squeak went away... Strange."
"asics I bought the gel-surveyor 3 shoe for over $100, and the gel-venture 5 for $50.  I don't run, but I spend alot of time on my feet like everyone else.  I love the venture 5 so much it's the one I wear all the time.  I only buy Asics, but very few shoe stores carry them. Made in China, but I like them. I've got $150 pair of NB in the closet that look great, but hurt like hell to wear. Everyones feet are differant and this shoe may not be for you, but for $50 I'm getting another pair. Hope they wear well.  Will let you know."
"asics Shoe feels good.  Good cushioning, fits good."
asics I have a wide foot so tried a 4E. They are too wide but still fit. 2E is the best size but wasn't availible. Still a good value shoe
"asics Good shoe, good support, can walk all day without tiring of the shoe. I've had several pairs relatively the same the past dozen years or so. Good value."
"asics I've always worn asics for running. As always they fit me great, quality and sizing is always consistent. The only complaint I have on this pair is the shoelaces. Both broke within a couple months of use. Cheap laces are an easy fix. But it'd be nice if they didn't cut corners there."
asics Acics Men's Gel Venture 5 running shoe fits well &amp; it's comfortable while on the run. The insoles feel good &amp; foot support is good.
asics The shoes fit well and are fine for use at gym. I have not had a chance to wear them in though. So far they are good for general use.
asics Love the shoes for walking. Go a half size up though for slightly wider feet. I have the Nimbus 18 and had to go half size up for comfort
asics These shoes are very comfortable. I've been an ASICS fan for a long time. Very satisfied with overall quality and comfort over the years.
"asics Asic,s are great quality running shoe, and at a price that is a great deal, these shoes shipped at a decent rate and I was very satisfied with the fit and durable quality I received... Thank you shipper."
asics The sole has already came apart.  I sent the company a message and never heard back.  I have worn the sneaker about 10 times and I just super-glued the sole back together.  The company never responded to my complaint.
"asics Ordered a 12 4E, plenty of room in the toe area, just a bit too narrow just forward of the heel. Overall a great shoe, very forgiving."
"asics great for my 9 yr old. good arches, he has very narrow feet and he finds these comfortable. there is a little extra space in there, but i don't think i could find better shoes for his ski shaped feet!"
"asics I did a lot of research for the right shoe to accommodate for my prorated step, and I'm glad that I finally settled on this shoe. The built in arch support is not uncomfortable or obstructive. It actually feels better to walk around in than the shoes that I wear with an inserted arch support. Plus, the colors match one of my gym pants!"
asics I love these shoes. My husband is a size 15 so it is hard to find good shoes for a reasonable price. I keep coming back to ASICS!
asics I like these shoes but they seem a little tighter than the newbalance I usually buy but time will tell overall they are not bad.
"asics Giving 3 stars. This is listed as a Running / Trail shoe but the sole is made out of a really hard plastic material that is very slippery. Even on just wet concrete I can take a few running steps and slide a good 4-5 feet. The inside of the shoe and sole starting falling apart after only a few months. I don't even use these shoes for running, just my daily footwear for work. I work in a warehouse, they aren't dirty and I'm walking on asphalt / concrete all day."
"asics My son, really likes the shoes. He's flat-footed and likes the arch support. Says they're very comfortable and they hold up well"
"asics I bought these for my dad as a gift because he needed a new pair of tennis shoes and he LOVES these shoes. Granted I know they are shoes, but my dad has always been one to wear bright white shoes so getting him this pair was very different for him but after he put them on, he kept saying, ""Man, these are NICE!"" Hahaha so adorable but I'm happy he loved them!"
"asics Bought the wide but still not as wide as most other brands. I can stretch them but, not convenient. If you normally wear wides you might want to check other brands."
asics The soles of the shoes are already starting to come apart in some places after only about 3 months of use.  Very disappointing.
asics I only buy Asics shoes do to my narrow feet and being flat footed.  I had the Gel Nimbus 10 before these and I loved those I just didn't want to spend another $150 for shoes.  These fit extremely well but are a little stiffer than the Nimbus series do to being trail shoes not road shoes.
asics They fit as expected.  I had a pair prior to purchasing these; so I knew how to order them.  I've been wearing Asics for years.
"asics Wish they were a little deeper.  My foot is small, but seems to slip at the heel because it is too high.  Superb construction and look."
asics Order came on time. No defects. Fits well and very comfortable. I'm one of the lucky one.  Thanks to reading the review before buying. My shoe size is size 9. So I order a 10. And it fits very well where I'm glad I didn't order the right size. Not sure if it will work for other people. Just wanted to put it out there.
"asics Good shoes, I went 1/2 size larger as some people suggested, I would probably like better my typical size. They do offer enough cushion and seem to be robust enough.<br/><br/>I am coming from the Asics Nimbus 16, which for me where excellent, except they do wear out quickly and tear. Still I use them around the house.<br/><br/>I wanted a shoe that had the Asics science behind it, I found this Venture  model to be the best bang for the buck in some site while using google. After weeks of searching for all brands, I chose this ones for being cheap, and feel happy I pulled the trigger.<br/><br/>I do recommend it. 4 Stars because it bends kind of awkward and gives a funny feeling in the side of your foot while walking,"
"asics I don't really run, but am fairly active and they fit as expected. I ordered an 11 which is my normal size and they fit great."
"asics Very comfortable shoes, for a great price. I bought them withe the intention of working out, but who am I kidding? Anyway, i wear them at work and they reduce my fatigue and eliminate foot soreness. =win"
"asics First run review: I'm a heavier, slower runner who overpronates and is conscientious about striking mid- foot. These shoes provided good space at the toes. They provided good support at the heel. I wish the arch support were just a little higher. The outside sole support is great. I am glad I bought these shoes as of now. Colors are just a little bolder in person, which I like. The ne were models are even bolder but more expensive. This is a good show for runners like me at this price point."
asics Love these shoes.  I have a hard to fit foot‚Ä¶ wide at the balls of my feet and normal at the heels. These shoes work better for me than any I have tried.
"asics This is my 5th pair, so I do like it. The haircut to 4 stars is that the sides ride and rub right on and under my ankle bones."
asics The rubber soles on both shoes began peeling away from the shoe itself not long after I bought them. Ive owned them 6 months now and its already time for a new pair of shoes. A person I work with also has the exact same pair and has dealt with the same problem 4 months after he purchased them.
"asics Use the shoe as is. If you need to use a custom insole, it will squeak when you walk. It is a very durable and stuctually sound shoe."
"asics Great shoe so far.  I took them on a hike in Valley of Fire state park in Nevada this past week, and they were very comfortable."
asics Replaced my faithful 15 yr old Merrill shoes for treadmill running. These fit just right and feel just as light as the Merrill's. No issues after my firs couple of runs.
asics I'm very glad I bought this shoes. They fit very well and feel very comfortable. One thing is that they are not waterproof.
asics The sizing is a little bit tight. I ordered 4E (extra wide) and they still are a little more than snug. So far they hold up well. I am pleased with the purchase.
asics Asics is the only shoe that fits my foot and remains comfortable for the life of the shoe. I wear a size 11 4E. These fit perfect.  I was pleasantly surprised how light they are. These are the lightest running shoes I have.
asics I read the reviews and bought a half size larger and they fit as they should. This must be a mistake at the factory with this shoe. My other ASICS (8-10 pair) have always fit for the correct size.<br/>They are a good pair. Very comfortable.<br/>I love the muted colors.<br/> I feel shoes are getting way too LOUD color wise. I don't need to be walking around in neon day glow colors.<br/>These are primarily walking everyday sport shoes not marathon running shoes.<br/> I really need some grey socks to go with this pair.<br/>BUT BUY A HALF SIZE LARGER THAN YOU NORMALLY WEAR!!!
asics Have only worn mine for a couple of days. The fit great and are comfortable. Seem well made<br/> I'd give them 5 stars but the insoles that come so them are way too thin.
"asics Perfect except for the cheap insoles which provide little cushion and constantly squeak! I thought they just needed to be broken in but it's been a month and it's still a problem. Will have to swap the insoles out for something of higher quality. On the plus side, they are removable so there's that."
"asics I normally wear size 13-14 shoes.  I ordered a size 13 and they seemed a little snug, so I exchanged them for size 14 and they fit great!  I have been having problems with plantar fasciitis in my right heel, regardless of trying different shoes and shoe inserts.  I have been wearing these ASICS for a couple of months now and my heel feels good even after wearing them all day!  They are very comfortable and look good as well.  Great value for the price!"
asics This is my third pair. I wear these for general purpose shoes. I have bad knees from jumping sports and the shoes have helped. I have worn these hiking and in rugged terrain like Galapagos lava hikes. They hold up well. Only minor complaint is the black mesh parts turn brown over time.
asics I've been buying Asics since the 90s when I switched from newbalance.  Always been pleased when I get new ones and these are no exception.  I get a new pair every 2 years and use the old ones as yard work shoes.
asics Great fit and comfortable. I wear these at work walking on concrete and gravel. I walk the dog and occasionally will run with them as well. So far they have held up well.
"asics I rarely ever buy shoes over the internet but based on the price and the good reviews of this sneaker, I figured I'd give them a try.  I've walked over 25 miles in them over the past week and I find them one of the most comfortable shoes I've owned in a long time.  I'd buy them again assuming they hold up over time.  The fit was as expected."
"asics My first pair of Asics and I'm sold.  I switched from newbalance because their quality has tanked.  These shoes are light, durable, breathable, and provide great support.  I got the black ones and they look quite good too.  Every shoe these days has too be shiny or reflective and tacky but these are the black mean looking sneakers I was looking for.  I've worn them on the treadmill at the gym, longs walks on pavement, and long hikes on the Appalachian trail for a couple months and they still looks and feel new.  I spray them off with a hose when they're muddy and let them dry in the sun.  They're always dry in a couple hours and still feel soft.  The pull strap on the back is heavy duty and very convenient. I usually have to use inserts in my newbalances, and these Asics are compatible, but I haven't needed one.  The included insert works fine for me.  No foot pain even after a 12 hour day of standing in one place at work.<br/><br/>The sizing was totally normal.  I wear a 10.5 in everything except Converse All Stars so that's the size I got and they fit perfectly.  I have a wider foot but I got the normal width and they fit me well so I think they run a bit wide.  I like them so much, and the price is so good, that I ordered a backup pair."
asics Bought as a hiking shoe.  Have worn once and it fits fine as expected from Asics.  Have worn running shoes for years. Not to flashy like many athletic shoes today.  Hope they hold up.  Great price.
asics Ran a half marathon and did a 6 day backpacking trip in the Grand Canyon with these sneakers all in the first month and they performed excellent for the challenge. Only issue is that the front part of the rubber sole right at the tip has become delaminated on both shoes.
"asics The shoe is a very comfortable.  I wanted something I could wear without having any pain, if I was to wear a sneaker all day and this is one of them.  I appreciate your business.  The only problem I have with the shoe is that the bottom sole is starting to come off already -_- but I guess that can happen to any of them.  I don't wear the sneaker as much as I want to but it happened.  I still have the laces in the original form that they arrived.  I wish this didn't happen but I am still happy with the shoe.  I don't know the next time I can purchase this brand, at full price, if it is not going to last.  Thanks again for your business"
"asics Ordered size 11D. Shoe tag and box says 11. Shoes are narrower in appearance out of the box, and feel a little tight (narrow). They are replacing another pair of Asics, which were not as narrow as these."
"asics Fantastic shoes! I bought these for running, but they will be going with me on a sea cruse as my deck and walking shoes!"
asics So comfortable! Fits perfectly. Even has a strap in the back that makes putting them on a snap. The laces aren't too long.
"asics Looks ok, fit ok but my feet were extremely tired after only a few hours of wearing. I added a cushioned liner and oddly that didn't help much. I never have that problem with Merrells."
"asics I like them, but initial break in always the worst part. Why do we only went a review for something so soon after we get them? Send out another review about a product a year after we've used them. After we've loved them or hated them. After we've seen how well they stand up to whatever purpose they were purchased for."
asics Very similar to another pair of Asics shoes I had owned previously.  These shoes are quite comparable to the others that I have owned.  Fit as expected.  A great value compared to what other stores were selling these shoes for.
asics I wear size 10.5 and these shoes felt smaller than that. Next time I will go one size up to an 11. I wore these shoes for a week and the bottom rubber is cheaply made what I mean by that is I have shoes that slip in water when they are suppose to be athletic shoes and resist water.
"asics I love Asics shoes, and they are recommended by my foot doctors! I have trouble finding them locally in a size 15, so I get mine on Amazon. This particular style (GEL-Venture) is my favorite. Ever though it says it is a running shoe, it is more of a walking shoe. It is thicker than most running shoes, and it holds up extremely well!!<br/><br/>I check back every few months for the latest version (this is the 5), and the latest colors for this style."
"asics I've had an old pair of ASICS for probably 3 years and they are very resilient. I've probably ran over 1000 miles in them, I've worn them boxing, street hockey and to the gym and besides for some wear and tear on the bottom they're still holding up. I needed a new pair and bought these and they fit perfect and the gel sole is very comfortable. I haven't worn them jogging yet but as a pharmacist, I'm on my feet all day and am very happy with them."
"asics I have ordered these shoes in the past, but I had to send my most recent pair back because the sole was separating from the rest of the shoe. I got a replacement, but it happened again. Poor quality, will not buy again even though I have been loyal to this brand."
"asics Bought these for my husband after I sent him info/reviews on a few different shoes. He normally buys some $140 shoes for work but lately they haven't been as high quality as in the past.  His dog walking shoes were what I was replacing here, however, he says these are so comfortable he could wear them all day at work.  Unfortunately, his work shoes have to be entirely black and these have just enough gray to disqualify him from wearing them there.  Great support and very good value."
"asics Pretty good running shoe. Not quite as cushiony as I expected, but still pretty decent shoe. I couldn't afford to pay $130 like I did with my last running shoes (Brooks Adrenaline), so for the price I'm pretty happy with them."
"asics The Gel Venture 5 is a little firmer than what I've been running in, but it was a true fit and is comfortable enough."
asics great shoes for running. they feel very sturdy and they feel very supportive when i'm running and doing hill sprints.
asics Got them shipped through Prime within USA and then to Qatar through Aramex Shop n Ship. Arrived in a plastic bag which was easy to open and the shoes were in ASICS box labelled as they were supposed to be.<br/><br/>Been using them as soon as they arrived. So far so good. Perfect fit for 10D. I will be using them for walking around. I hope they are good and feel as comfortable as they do right now after a few weeks of use!
"asics ASICS ARE THE BEST! We only wear this brand. My husband wore newbalance for years until we found this brand. He goes to the gym every day and runs, bikes, etc. and finds they are extremely comfortable. He is very flat footed and finds them to be great for that as well as a bad back  which includes 2 back surgeries. He has always found them to run true to size.  These shoes are a great color and look way more expensive than they actually were."
asics I like them just fine. A tiny bit wider than my Saucony pair but these Asics are my-go to shoes now and work very well.
"asics I burn thru a pair of these every 6 months - great fit, support and quality - always go back to a new pair of the ASICS gels....."
asics Love these shoes!  I use them for xfit workout and they made one hell of a difference.<br/><br/>LOVE THESE SHOES!
"asics Great deal(45$), asics always hold up great for my workouts, and this shoe is well built and sturdy and very comfy."
"asics Great for trail running or jogging, and even comfortable for some trail walking on level ground.  I find them comfortable for a daily light jog on a gravel road, with a little sprinting on paved hard top. The double-wide width fit as expected."
asics Was nervous buying a pair of shoes without trying them on. Size was perfect and very comfortable. Couldn't be happier.
"asics I wear these shoes to work every single day, and they are by far the best support I've ever experienced. I would buy these exact shoes again and again."
asics Left shoe was sewn incorrectly causing the side to collapse &amp; squeeze my foot constantly.<br/>Very uncomfortable - had to return for an exchange of a pair in a different color scheme.
asics Ordered these shoes that claim to be 12.5 4 E they are too short and to narrow you better order atleast a size bigger than you need.
"asics It you need good arch support, these are not the shoe for you.  Others seem to like them.  They made my feet hurt."
asics Not the comfort I'm used to from asic. I had to change the insole in order to wear these. The inside it brought was worthless.
"asics Been wearing Asics gel running shoes for years. Great shoes.  Very comfortable.  Started wearing them after my Doctor recommended them for plantar fasciitis.  He had plantar fasciitis also and had great success with them. I wish there was a larger select of narrow sizes, but the mediums fit pretty well.  Bought my last 3 pair at a specialty store. Unfortunately they retired so Amazon was the best choice for available size, color and price."
"asics I've always bought Skechers, and really like Puma, but these shoes are very comfortable and seem to be made well."
"asics I needed some shoes that I would be okay with ruining for doing work outside. These shoes are pretty good. I tried them on at a sporting goods store first to make sure they fit, but at the store they were $40 more expensive, and the store didn't price match, so I decided to just order them form amazon.<br/><br/>These shoes to give me a blister, but the blister is in the same spot where virtually every other shoe gives me a blister, so I think that this is a fault of my feet an not the shoe."
"asics These shoes were purchased for my husband last year.  He loved them!  Thought they were very comfortable.  The only downside is that they do not last long.  This month we had to purchase more shoes for him because these were coming apart on the soles of the shoes.  So if you enjoy a pair of shoes that fit well and are comfortable but you may not wear them every day like he did, these would be good for you.  However, if the amount of money paid for one year or less wear of the shoe is not worth it to you, then I would check out some other shoe."
"asics Ive owned 2 pair of these Venture 5 I bought last year this time , I walk 3 miles on the treadmill with the incline set at 3  going 4 mph and these shoes have held up better than any running shoes I've owned , I've ordered another pair and am waiting on them , they run a little small normally I wear 10 and half and 11 fit perfect. The last pair of shoes I owned was Skechers with the Memory Foam and they fell apart in 3 months. You can't remove the Memory Foam it's part of the shoe."
"asics plastic feelilng on the outside of the shoe.  inside felt great, but  half size too small, had to exchange them."
asics And too tight.  Needs a wider area for the toes etc.  Love the color.  It has adequate space for the orthopedic insoles.
asics Great Sneaker for Cement roadway running and walking. Really took the pain out of my legs after i bought these.
"asics I ordered ""wides"" in these, and I received ""wides"", but they are on the small side.  They feel more like regular width shoes."
"asics Very uncomfortable. Too tight .My shoe size is correct, shoe is sized wrong."
"asics I bought them for my son who is only 10 years old but has large foot so I have to take an extra size. He tried his new runners and he says they are very comfortable. I can tell when he runs that his feet are well supported. It is a good choice for a reasonable price. Regarding the design, they are very nice !"
"asics My favorite brand of running shoe. I used Asics exclusively when i competed in cross country races and for training in track and field. Although I no longer participate in those activities, I absolutely love these shoes for running outside and on the treadmill."
"asics Pretty ugly, but a great running/walking shoe. Much better than my Nike Air Pegasus that were over 2x the cost."
"asics Great fit, great cushioning.  Love the laces too.  Thank you for a quality product.  Good value for the price."
"asics This is my second pair of ASICS Gel Venture, where my previous one was the 4 (this is the 5).  It is a simple and good walking shoe, and I use them to walk to work every day.  I wear a size 15, and I typically prefer Nike's for the cool factor.  The ASICS definitely aren't as cool as the Nike Flyknits, but for less than half the price you can't go wrong.  Also, they're truly more comfortable shoes and have a million times better arch support, and just general support and comfort."
"asics Good, comfortable shoe over all. Been wearing about 3 weeks for work. Longevity will be the question for me which is why I took off 1 star. If these shoes hold up to my rigorous routine, then I'll be back to update to 5 stars, or less for failure to hold up.  Good value for the price!"
asics I have a wide foot and I have plantar fasciitis The fit for this shoe is just as expected. The foot bed has a lateral stiffness but with a cushion heel. Just what you expect from a trail running shoe.
asics If not laced properly I could see this shoe's reviews coming in as somewhat large. Very good comfort and support. I use these 3 days a week for a 4 mile walk and they feel great.
"asics On my feet 8-12 hrs a day. A couple days to break in, now they fit like a glove. We'll see how they hold up. Great price. So far so good..."
"asics These shoes are too narrow for sweat socks.  Folks it is a running shoe.  You should be able to wear a pair thick socks, right?  Not a chance."
asics This is my first pair of asics. My wife recently purchased a pair and it got me interested.  They arrived on time and in great shape. After wearing them around the office for an afternoon I'm quite content. They offer very nice pading and I'm confident that they will be great when I finally get out on the trail.
asics Liked the look of them but they were a little on the larger size compared to other other pair of ASICS.  However my biggest dislike was that when I walked they made a swooshing sound.  Above my toes was a plastic like material that makes sound when my toes hit it.  I assume its there to make them more durable but when your walking you can here it swooshing.
"asics Way too soon to tell actually. I am concerned somewhat about durability. However, most of these concerns are abated by the fact the sizing is true. So, 4E is really wide, as it should be. So, there shouldn't be any undo stress on the shoe. Very lightweight, which is great. Comfy enough as well. However, the sole doesn't seem supple enough to wear well. It looks like it will split between the treads, as others have posted. We'll see."
"asics I've had many of these shoes and they perform as expected.  Price is great, shoe fits well, and hold up.  I like the trail runners - the treads are also good if you're on a dirt trail."
asics About a half size too small compared to my exact same shoe but Amazon is awesome and replaced them posthaste
"asics I purchased these shoes for my grandson for cross country.  He loves them.  Likes the way they fit, and the way they look.  Hopefully they will hold up well for the full season."
asics Great pair. I use it for walking around as well as my cardio gym classes. Very good fit. Definitely recommend
"asics I used to wear Nike shoes before so my reviews may be a little biased. These shoes are decent value for money. They don't feel heavy, do ok on rough usage. I have two problems with this shoe: the laces don't hold up very well in the long run and the body of the shoe is not flexible enough. But that may not be the case if you put a little more money on any ASICS shoe as well."
asics Perfect for all day concrete standing.  I work at a large warehouse with concrete floors and so far so good. Not memory foam which is great.  Just support.
"asics Fit as expected but the color is not gold on navy blue.  The blue is too light, looks like a woman's style."
"asics I bought this shoe to correct my under-pronation.  However, I found the fit to be very snug at the big toe. I gave the shoes two tries at the gym before deciding to return them. My last several pairs of sneakers were Asics, so this pair was an unexpected disappointment."
"asics The shoes were fine just a bit to tight, I ended up ordering a different type shoe that was a wider at the toes."
"asics Really love Asics running shoes. This pair fits perfectly. Have had a couple situations when they didn't but, this one restores my confidence."
"asics Great shoe, price is extremely fair given the quality of the product.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a comfortable shoe at a good price."
"asics I have been wearing ASICS shoes since 2010, usually buy 1-2 pairs each year as I seem to wear them out pretty fast. The last two purchases have been too tight, not sure why. I thought they'd be ok after I break them in but after 2 weeks of daily wear, this most recent pair is still uncomfortably tight. I'll be donating these &amp; won't be buying ASICS again."
asics I got them for my husband as a fathers day gift. He loves them. Said they are the best shoes he has ever had!! Win
"asics My husband bought this exact brand and make of shoes 4+ years ago and they've held up well to every day, all day usage. After 4 years they're starting to look dingy so I bought him another pair in a different color from Amazon. The fit is identical, as are the outside of the shoes. The old pair are still going strong and being reserved for chores and dirty work, while the new pair are now the every day pair.<br/><br/>I was so pleased that the fit and style was exactly the same even 4 years later. Additionally, these run true to size."
"asics The shoe itself is very durable. Flexible toe box, without too much give. The midsole is semi-flexible, but is better for straight ahead movements. Not an ideal training shoe, but great for running or working out in mainly sagittal plane. Heel counter is semi-rigid, but has good contact with skin to ensure good fit. Very comfortable, but slightly narrow for individuals who have bunions. Perhaps order wider size to get around this. All around phenomenal shoe for its listed price."
"asics It t has been many years since I purchased by last pair of Asics shoes.  I have very large feet and my size is difficult to find.  I have been where newbalance.  I liked the style of these and found them in "" My Size"", not all shoes run true to size.  These fit as expected, and when I where these out in three months I will purchase another pair."
"asics Very light. Great for woking out, elliptical, etc. I paid $40 and wouldn't want to pay a whole lot more."
asics I am not a podiatrist.<br/><br/>Fits as expected; like a small high heel; flexor; keeps me on me toes.
asics My husband has a short wide foot so I got him a 4E width in size  10 which was perfect. He says they're the most comfortable sneakers he has ever worn and he normally wears them for ten to twelve hours a day and he is on his feet the whole time.<br/>I've come to the conclusion that most people with wide feet especially in the toe box probably never realized that they need to find extra wide shoes when available.<br/>I'd definitely buy these again.
asics so far so good. I had a similar pair Asics that lasted me longer than any other pair of running shoe I had previously. I am not a runner. I get on the treadmill and put on about 3 miles a day at a 4.2 mph pace 20 times per month. I figure my old Asics lasted me about a year before I retired them to everyday use. These seem to be very similar so I expect and hope for the same. The only issue i had was that I did replace the inner sole to get an extra 3 months or so out of them.
"asics Great shoes so far, not as soft as some of the Asics running shoes but perfect for everyday use/walking"
asics This is my 4th pair of basically this same style of Asics over the past 5 years and they fit well and have enough room for my orthotics.
asics only ever heard great things about this companies shoes i get them the fit great feel great but two weeks into wearing them the heals have rubbed away i have constant cuts on my heals from the plastic backing rubbing on me all day i don't run in them or do any thing extreme mowed the lawn once i sit at a desk and just wanted something comfy that was supportive now i have brand new shoe breaking down on me.
"asics Great shoes for the price! I put some orthotics that I picked up on Prime Day and together, they are great!"
asics The extra wide is wide enough for large feet. I recommend sizing up a half size for toe room. The shoe is made well and is sturdy. The picture is pretty accurate in color.
"asics Lasted for me so far, I run every weekend and on other off days. Fits with what I expect from my size, no problems"
"asics As always, one can count on Asics shoes to look good and fit properly. I Could not ask for a more comfortable , better looking , better fitting shoe."
asics I ordered them a size bigger than I need and they are still very tight. I thought with the mesh over the toe they would be cool but they are not cool at all. quite hot when you have them on for several hours.
"asics Great shoe, looks like it'll last me a while. I put on lots of miles a I love to walk.<br/>Tread looks likes it'll last."
"asics I have owned this pair before and they fit very well and last a long time, excellent for my purposes."
"asics I love Asics running sneakers. I am a female, but for some reason most lady shoe options are made in ostentatious colors and patterns (fine for running, less fine for serious events). I wear a women's 8.5 wide, so I bought these slate and black sneakers in a 7. I believe Men's shoes are made a bit wider than women's, so the standard men's 7 was almost perfect -- a touch narrower than I'd like but I assumed that when I ordered them. Such a good trade-off for a color scheme that I can wear for lectures, conventions, and any occasion I do not want to wear bright pink, sea-foam, and purple -- haha! Great seller. Great price."
"asics For me it is a great fit, I am on my feet most of the day and I like the comfort and feel of the shoe."
"asics ASICS sneakers are my long time favorite.  Light, comfortable and long lasting.  Highly recommended."
"asics Comfortable shoe. On my feet all day at work, so I find myself looking for something that will provide comfort along with durability.  I'm a pretty big guy:  6'7"", 290#.  Had plantar fasciitis in both feet for a year.  Tried ASICS and their shoes had enough cushion (along with therapy and stretching) to allow my feet to heal and still stay on my feet at work.  ASICS are my ""go to"" shoe now."
"asics Absolutely love these running shoes.  So amazing on trails.  Light, and they feel like they propel me forward!"
"asics Get a half size larger. I normally wear 11.5 and the 12 fits perfect. I've had a few pair of the Gel Nimbus and Cumulus in the past, and honestly I can't tell much difference in fit and comfort of this much cheaper model as compared to those pricy ones (although I've been wearing a Nimbus model for 6 years now and they are still holding up nicely)."
"asics This is the first pair of Asics I have bought that I have not been happy with. The arch support is lower than I like, the shoelaces don't stay tied when running, and the fabric has an unsightly wrinkle on the inner side of both shoes. The shoes do feel very sturdy and I think they look better in person than they do in the pictures (except for the wrinkle on the side). I will continue to buy Asics shoes but I will not by this one again.<br/><br/>I wear size 11, 4E"
"asics Nice shoe to workout in, I find myself buying men shoes in a smaller cheaper size than a women's shoe in a larger and more pricier, these shoes fit just as good."
"asics I purchased a pair of size 11's. Great running shoes. They're comfortable and well made from what i can tell. However, I originally bought these as working shoes, and i work in a kitchen. These shoes have absolutely no traction and slide around everywhere, even if the floor's not wet. I do not recommend these shoes unless you're explicitly looking for running shoes"
asics Very good shoes. Light and durable. I've put about 150 miles into them and they're still comfortable and look new.
"asics My second pair!  Love these shoes.  Comfortable, relaxing, just a fine shoe.  Will continue to buy them as they wear out.  Jim"
"asics This is an okay sneaker for around the house and light walking. But with any heavy walking, I got blisters! If you put a lot of miles on them, get the new Kayano 23's!!"
"asics I previously had ASIC's in a size 9EE.  Lately my NB have been 9EEEE. So I decided to give these a try at 9EEEE. Incredibly the left sneaker is not quite wide enough and it pinches the side of my foot. Old ASIC's made in Vietnam. New ones from China. It is too bad they can't have a uniform last.  Trying to break them in to fit, but that should not be how it works."
"asics I purchased these shoes for my husband who normally wears a 15 Medium in a running shoe. This was the first time trying Asics as he normally wears newbalance. These seemed to run a bit narrow and were too snug on his feet. Aside from running narrow, he really liked them a lot. They did not offer the shoe in a wider width in his size, and that is the only reason we returned without an exchange. Nice shoe for the money."
"asics My husband is a security guard and he manages to wear through these every couple of months, but they are the only shoes that he will wear. We tried another type of shoe, but after walking 12 miles a night, the shoes fell apart and were bothering his back. The shoes fit very well, holding their form, even after weeks and weeks of constant use. We used to pay a lot more for these shoes, so we almost have these on a subscription to get them before the other ones get too bad."
"asics I lean towards a medium to narrow feet and these fit perfectly.  Very comfy, light and looks great!"
asics Absolutely love them.... great price and more comfortable fhan shoes cost three to four times as much!
"asics These are great shoes with their look and feel.  They fit a little snug, but that is only because I wear them all day at the office (for the great look) instead of what I bought them for - as running shoes. Ran in them one time and the run was excellent - better than the newbalance shoes I have run in traditionally (but that was only after the first run). SO in short - great as running shoes, fit me a little too snug if I double them as office casuals."
"asics Had to order a size up as the 10.5 was a little snug on his feet. Besides that, they are great shoes!!"
"asics Comfortable....... Quality ""almost"" as good as newbalance !............. I find that newbalance is similar, BUT seems to me, that newbalance is made of Better materials."
"asics Sole not holding up as well as I could have wished for, but still I've gotten good use out of them"
"asics Great shoes, nice look. They are not as soft as other running shoes because these ones are more oriented to trail running."
asics so far I'm thrilled with these shoes.  I'm going to purhcase another pair to add to the rotation.
"asics ASICS Men's Gel Venture 5 Running Shoe,...; great price for the quality;  item comes as described"
"asics Extremely stiff out of the box, toe box is very tight, and overall not as good as the previous model.  The previous ones were wider and more comfortable.  These ones made my tendonitis flare up within a half mile, opposed to 2 miles."
"asics After years with newbalance, I have switched. Great shoe perfect fit for my wide feet. Very happy"
asics Really nice quality. I use them for work; I do a lot of video production. They're great for what I use them for. Good for running or hiking too.
asics They fit great. I have always worn brooks beast in 11 4E but have recently been blowing out the sides of them for some reason in a matter of 3 months.  These Asics are less than half the price and feel comfortable. I have super flat feet and the insoles in these felt good from the start though I did replace them with some sole custom mold able orthotics to add some cushion and support. Overall for the price these are great and meeting my needs perfectly.
asics these were supposed to be a wide shoe. They were narrow I can wear them for few hours at a time.
asics I have been wearing Asics shoes for years so I knew exactly what to expect and I was not disappointed.
"asics For the lower cost Asics shoes, they are great. A bit stiffer and lighter than the more expensive $115 cousins but great fit. I use these as work shoes.<br/>Feel like ordering another pair before the design changes again."
"asics I usually have problems with athletic shoes not giving me enough support and making my feet and ankles hurt. I did not have that problem with these shoes. I went shopping the other day and spent about four hours walking around almost continuously with no aches and pains that I normally get. This is the third pair of ASICS that I've owned and they have always been great long lasting shoes. Do not be afraid to order these shoes, they are wonderful."
"asics These are my favorite running/hiking shoes! They are very comfortable and are deceivingly light weight! The soles are also very durable. I've put miles and miles on these shoes and they are still holding up very well! I purchased a second pair as a backup when my first pair finally breaks down, which I'm hoping won't be for quite some time. Asics definitely created something amazing with these running shoes! Highly recommended!"
"asics Great shoe Great price,  I wear shoes a long time so still breaking in, well made, nice looking"
asics Best shoes they ever made. You can wear em all day and proform all sorts of task. From walking to hiking to working at the docs unloading shipment.
asics These are the ONLY running shoes my husband likes to wear. I also wear the ladies ASICS. Best support and very durable.
asics Seem to be well made - definitely running shoes first - tread pattern is not super-aggressive.
"asics Finally, a shoe that fits my foot. I have a high instep, and a high arch. This shoe fits good and supports my arches."
"asics I absolutely adored these shoes when I bought them. I wear a size 16 so finding shoes that fit me AND look good isnt always easy. But these were great. They were a bit too wide. Not enough to cuase blisters or anything dire, but enough to be an inconvenience. Otherwise great shoe!"
asics They fit like a glove. I have traditionally worn Pearl Uzumi's but tried these because they were on sale.  They have worked great so far.
"asics Being in the military for over 20 years these are the shoes that work best for me, I'm an avid runner and will run roughly 30 miles per week and these shoes work great for the no so perfect roadways that I run on. The last pair I had were just like this and I've logged over 4000 miles on them. These show exactly the same performance and fit exactly the same."
"asics These are nice shoes, but they are not trail running shoes. The tread is too shallow, the strike plate is too flexible, the shoe cap is very soft, the sides are too thin, and the upper mesh is very porous. The shoe deforms on hard down hill runs and the tread grip is ""slippery"".<br/><br/>The shoe over communicates the impact of hard objects (rocks / tree roots) and under communicates terrain changes (down / up hill changes). Your foot feels locked in place due to the odd flexibility of the sole, and your ankles have to really compensate for the shoe's performance on steep terrain changes."
asics Absolutely love it. Fit as expected. So comfortable. And very high quality. Highly recommended
"asics I have always preferred acics as they seem to fit the best, but these especially last a while"
asics Great shoes for walking or hiking.  The Asics Gel foot-bed really is comfortable and the overall fit is spot on!
"asics They felt like they would have good support, but they were half a size small and very narrow."
"asics Great shoes. I wear them at work and I've been using them for months now and they hold up better than my newbalances at a higher price which lasted only a few months. I dig the dark grey/black look, basic, durable, comfortable, nice wide fit, I would buy them again."
"asics My favorite model of running shoes! Very comfortable for a high, narrow arch. I run in these year round in Maine!"
asics I'm on my fourth pair of these shoes. As they age they go from casual shoes to running shoes to trail shoes to grass cutting shoes. Took 2 pairs overseas with me and they survived PT through the sand and rocks of the desert. I couldn't ask for more from these shoes.
"asics I'm on my feet 10-hours walking concrete floors at work, and needed a new pair of sneakers to replace my worn out ones. For a little over $50 with shipping these work great. Little to no discomfort after the first day (when paired with Spenco insoles) but I'll be back with an update after a couple of months."
"asics Excellent sneakers for the price. I run a lot (3-5 times a week) and these have served me well. Due to the price, I don't expect them to last as long as a higher end sneaker, but so far, they've been great. Great support and comfort, and I can run 5 miles without an issue. I haven't run further than 5 miles at any one point so I don't know how well they are for marathoners. I expect them to wear out in the next couple of months, but for the price I paid, I'm ok with that."
"asics After a few years of not having a pair of ASICS in my closet, I decided to get a new pair.  The fit of the shoe feels as if it were made just for my feet.  Can't say enough about the great fit and comfort.  I don't use them for running, but I do use them when I know I will be doing a lot of walking and activity.  They worked great for an aggressive trail/hill climb!  I will be keeping this pair of ASICS in my rotation and can't say enough about the comfort and fit."
asics accurate fit/sizing; good support so far using in gym setting.  Haven't had long enough to comment on durability
asics They are good shoes. I opted to not pay the extra $50-60 for the flashy color and I'm satisfied.
"asics These shoes were for my husband. He normally wears size 11.5 to 12 and ordered the size 12 based on reviewers' comments. They fit perfectly. He went for a 5 mile run with them right out of the box and they were comfortable and his feet felt great. I checked 'yes' for good arch support but his answer to that was ""I didn't notice that there wasn't good arch support"" so take that for what it's worth. The shoes look great. They are lightweight for running. He is very happy with this purchase."
"asics These came on time, they fit as expected and the width was as expected.  We absolutely love the 2000 line of shoes, we've been wearing them for years.  The ones in the stores are either too expensive or they are in wild colors.  Ordering them only whether it's last years model works great for us because they are less expensive and have more color options.  Please don't quit making these shoes!!  WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!  Both my husband and I wear the GT2000 for stability for running."
asics I bought these for my husband and so far they feel great! Ive worn them a couple of times also and they have a great arch! Lots of support.
asics Came in new condition as expected without blemishes<br/>I owned a pair of ASICS prior so they fit as expected.<br/>Have put 10 miles on them already and they feel like they're going strong.<br/>No adverse feeling when running with these
asics Fits well. I am a woman but I buy men's shoes because the width is ideal for my giant man feet. Would recommend
asics I've worn Asics shoes for a long time and expect good  quality. These shoes fit great and are very comfortable. I'm a happy customer.
"asics First shoes that I've bought for running as I am a novice. I've worn Puma and Addidas for cross training, but want a shoe designed for running exclusively. I have a wider and flatter foot and run more on my heels than toes. Clearly not ideal for running, however I felt like trying to see what I can do. I like the shoes and they fit as sized. I've been on them for the week and would give them five stars if I was in love. I will wear these out and try another shoe, but with that said I am not disappointed at all."
"asics bought 10.5 for hubby, he has wide feet, his feet hurt him from standing on job,,he says there like the best sneaker,,,,will buy again"
asics Great sneakers very nice but be careful when they get wet very slippery  when they get wet
"asics As others wrote,  initially the shoes are a bit stiff but that's not a complaint. They fit snugly and are very comfortable and you can wear them all day long and your feet don't get tired. Trail runners are more sturdy than regular running shoes so they are great for walking and daily activities. This is my second pair - the first pair are now my painting and yard shoes."
"asics After 3 months of use, which consisted of light walking around the office, these sneakers have started to fail. The bottom layer of the soul is peeling away at the outside edges of both shoes. Even for a budget shoe this a pretty quick failure. I've been running in the Gel Nimbus line shoes for years and they are still as great as ever, but beware of Asics' budget shoes."
"asics Good fit, good grip, comfortable down to pretty low temperatures. Soles get a bit weird when it's really cold outside, but then it's really not a winter shoe. I generally wear size 11 or 45 in Euro shoes normal width and these fit perfectly. I'd like a little more support from the insoles to give it a full 5 stars, but they are removable if you want more arch support with something like a heat formed insole"
"asics No more back, shoulder or knee pain. Get you one. Didnt believe the hype till I brought one."
"asics These shoes, at least for me, are horrible.  After trying them out for a week, I had to switch back to my old worn out pair of running shoes because of the ankle, foot, and knee pain they created.  I Could not believe how bad they were.  Within a day if switching back to my old shoes all the pain was gone.  I don't know if its a bad design or what but I won't be using them any more."
"asics shoe was OK at first, but a hole wore in it very quickly.  Had to replace after 3 months."
"asics Not the quality of higher priced models like Asics Kayano, but just fine for the price and for non-intense activity."
"asics I wear this as a RN, I go through about 2-3 pair a year and these are my go to work shoes"
asics this is the 3rd pair I've gotten.  The only complaint I have is that they wear out too fast.
asics Bottom rubber began to separate almost immediately<br/>Used only for basic yardwork and walking in the woods.
asics Very comfortable but heel wears down faster then other brands. Otherwise I would give 5 star rating.
"asics I love these shoes! I'm a big guy (6'1"", 370lbs), and these provide all of the support I could want. Sizing was perfect. As a bonus, the blue and orange match my toothbrush."
"asics Asics bring great value to a trail running shoe.  Unlike some shoes that claim their are ""trail"" these really are.  In other words the sole is STIFF and not flexy.  They are a little ugly but whatever."
"asics Really nice shoe for the price. Fits as expected, provides good support. Sturdily made."
"asics I had Gel Venture 4 before these and they were comfortable, affordable, and lasted a long time so I was comfortable ordering Gel Venture 5's from Amazon at the same size. I'm very happy with them after 1 week. More comfortable than my GV4s. There are a couple very minor pressure points near the outside balls of my feet but not enough for me to notice unless I'm really paying attention. I was on my feet all day Saturday in these and they felt great all day. Very happy."
asics 4E 8.5 and it still seems like a tight fit.  my newbalance same size fit a lot better.
asics Nice shoe.  Comfortable.  Great fit.  Fairly light weight.  Looks good.  Happy with my purchase.
"asics The color is sensational.  Just enough different to stand out.  Quality, good fit and value.  Great shoe."
asics Can't beat $40 for the black version.  Click around on different colors and you'll see these were the cheapest but they fit the same as the others and since their black/grey they don't show as much dirt.  Super comfy shoes.
asics They are the same size as my last 4 or 5 pairs were but aren't wide enough
asics Normally don't wear wide shoes. Wish I bought them on these. They fit but are a little tight.
asics Aspics never disappoint!  They are a great spots shoe with good construction and style!
"asics So far I'm in love with these shoes! Only a couple runs in, lets see how they hold up."
asics These shoes are supportive and comfortable. I have wide feet and they still fit as expected. Great for the price!
"asics I purchased the Carbon/Black/Hot Orange version of the ASICS Men's GEL-Venture 5 based on the product photo used by Amazon at the time (Nov 14, 2015). Unfortunately, Amazon used a photo of an earlier version and different style than the one available (see attached original photo). They have recently corrected the issue. While the shoes fit properly, and seem to be well-made, I wouldn't have bought them had the proper photos been shown. A little gaudy for my taste. However, if the current photo suits you, then by all means go for it."
"asics I have been purchasing newbalance shoes for a while now, but was having issues with them wearing out too quickly. I can't tell if these are really lasting any better, however they do fit my feet a lot better than any other shoe brand I have used."
asics Great fit. Really like the colors. Supportive in all the right places. I needed a new pair for work and am really happy with the shoes and the price couldn't be better for this quality.
asics Great shoe for the price. ASICS is great brand. This shoe is a tad heavier than others I've used but very comfortable for a walking hiking shoe
asics Bought these for my son.  I was a bit skeptical since they were an open box special value.  Upon inspection they were virtually in brand new condition.  If you looked an the sneakers sole with the utmost scrutiny there were a few signs they may have been worn for a day.  The rest of the entire sneaker looked fantastic.  I would buy some for either myself or him again through the open box specials again.  Virtually new sneakers for about 50% off works for both me and my wallet.
asics These fit narrow. I wear D width measured by shoe stores several times and always buy D shoes and they fit. This shoe on me in D width is bulging at the forefoot too narrow. So if you wear a D mens boot buy wide in these.
"asics THIS BRAND USED TO FIT WITH MY REGULAR SIZE. DUE TO MANUFACTURING NOT BEING THE SAME, THEY NOW RUN SMALLER THAN THEY DID BEFORE."
"asics These shoes are better than I expected for less than $50. I was a little hesitant from some of the previous reviews I read about being tighter than expected. Honestly fit like a glove for me with a good arch support. Someone had complained about the soles being to stiff. Not so. No you're not walking on a cloud. If that was the case, the impact from running would shudder your body with that soft of a sole. These soles offer the right about of cushion and resistance for me. Already took them on a good hike and they performed admirably."
"asics I like the shoe, seems well constructed and very lightweight, however they definitely run small. I'm returning the second pair in a week and ordering a full size larger than I normally take.<br/><br/>I'll update this review when they come in."
"asics Asics definitely has a problem with sizing consistency. Last year, 11.5 was uncomfortably small (I have worn 11s prior) I ordered 12's this time and they were HUGE!  I will not buy Asics online again."
asics Always count on Asics for being consistent with there sizing and quality. Great shoe
asics Typical great ASICS shoe. I have had many types and am always satisfied. They seem to fit me better than Nikes.
asics Best shoes for my daily use and light jog. This is my second pair. My first pair has been 3 years and I still use it sometimes.
asics My Stepson really likes them.  His feet don't hurt anymore after a 5 mile hike.  They fit so well this is his third pair of the same shoe.
"asics I have bought and worn Asics shoes for many years.  Once in a great while I get the urge to try another brand. Bad decision. I like Asics because they fit, look good and are good quality. Oh yes fairly priced."
"asics Perfect in every way. It's hard for me to find shoes that fit. Visited every shoe store in my area, found very few options. Amazon had exactly what I was looking for!"
asics These tennis shoes claim chubby 5 x wide. They did not come close befitting my extra wide feet. I would not recommend them to a person who has wide feet
"asics I purchased these for my husband, he loves them, there was no break in period, fit great the first time he put them one. He walks 5+ miles a day, these stay comfortable. In fact, I just purchased a 2nd pair for when these wear out."
"asics glad I looked around as these shoes are great.  Light weight, good support, and I like the look for a good price"
asics Very comfortable and breathable. Exactly what my sweaty feet needed. Now everyone can experience my foot odor!
"asics Somewhat small on the fit, I'd suggest going up one size more for a comfortable fit."
"asics I bought these for my 14 year old 6'3"" son. He is very difficult to fit. These come in a variety of widths and they fit perfectly. They are well made, quality shoes. No complaints other than a bit pricey."
"asics A 4 because they look good and fit good, haven't had them long enough to rate higher( duration is the key!)"
asics Love these shoes! Great aggressive tread that hasn't let me down. I've used and abused them almost daily for runs and muscular training for 6 months without any issues. Nothing's better than ASICS!
"asics So far I've only worn them for one workout, they were just as comfortable as my old ones."
asics I bought my first pair almost a year ago and have since bought a second pair for work. I work as a painter and these shoes have so far held up to vigorous work and climbing etc. They have proven extremely durable and reliable as I wear these for almost every activity whether it's at work or hiking which sometimes get soaked but being that they are so breathable they are bone dry in an hour or two. Best bang for your buck
asics So far they have been great shoes. Asics seem to be my shoe...they are true to size and fit me well
asics I bought these in a size 11 E (wide) for my husband who is 6ft 270lbs. He loves them! Has been wearing them everyday and bragged about them all day long of how good they feel on his feet. Great buy for a complainer.
"asics These are my first pair of ASICS running shoes and I love them.  They are super comfortable and look great, I've gone running in them several times now and I don't have anything bad to say about them at all.  With other running shoes that I've had I just want to take them off as soon as I finish my run.  Not with this pair, I could wear them the entire day and my feet will be fine..  I use them only for running but I'm very tempted to make them my everyday casual shoes."
asics May be the best shoes I have ever owned. I have a pronation tendency and these help as advertised...
"asics Initial support is good, not great. I seldom purchase Asic shoes because they do not have the same support as other brands at  the same price point. I do not feel they hold up as well as other brands. The shoes look nice. They are light. They are now my go to grass cutting shoes. I do not look to buy other pairs."
"asics Husband wears them and hasn't complained. He picked them. He's happy, I'm happy."
asics I have had foot issues for years and these are the only brand of shoes I will wear
"asics A little bulkier than I'd expected, but perfect for trail running. ""Durable"" is the description that comes to mind."
"asics Got these for my 13 yr old son.  He likes them a lot, nicely made and they fit him well."
asics Shoe fit as expected except it was to narrow. I needed a 2E.  otherwise the shoe felt great.
"asics Size purchased: 10.5<br/>Though it started on the snug side and a bit uncomfortable it took about a week give or take a day or so, of putting them on, wearing them and taking them off for it to truly be broken in<br/>All and all: a valuable purchase I do not in any way shape or form regret in the slightest"
asics I am using the same shoes since many years. Helped my APFT army career as well Fit Civilian career.  Best running and workout shoes. This my 4th pair from Asics. I always buy the same color too :) !
asics Wearing them everyday at work. I'm on my feet a lot and they're very comfortable.
asics I was expecting them to be a little loser<br/>but I think  they will be just fine.
"asics I fell in love the moment I put them on. Not only are they functional, but they're fashionable too. No, not saying I'd ever wear these do a formal dinner party lol, but I'm just saying...they look great! Stop over thinkin it and hit that purchase button. You won't regret it. Only thing I'd recommend is putting in additional soles (for the ultimate comfort)."
"asics I love these shoes, makes running seamless and the size is nearly perfect. I will continue to buy ASCIS in the future."
asics Great shoes for the price! One of the only brands that come in 4E for my flipper feet!
asics Fits perfectly!  My third pair.  I run 4-5 miles 6 days a week.  Each pair lasts me 4-6 months.  Most of my running is on asphalt.  My local stores no longer carry this product so I bought the shoes online.
"asics I have had these shoes for several months now and they have served me well. They did run a little large compared to other shoes I have purchased, I'm usually a 12 and would have been better off in an 11.5 with these. My only complaint is that there was a little bit of separation of the sole where it curves up onto the toe of the shoe. Otherwise, they have held up well under almost daily wear."
"asics I bought these to replace my black daily Nikes which got old. Having some gel cummulus which are about $100 more expensive i thought id give these a chance because of the price without expecting a big deal, how mistaken i was, these are great and i can go the whole day with them and feel nothing on my feet, theyre relatively light and feel good and provide a nice arc support, now ill be ordering more of these as Asics becomes my new favorite brand."
asics Went to the shoe store tried out the same brand. Went off that size and bought on Amazon. They fit perfect. This is my second set of shoes I've bought on Amazon. I run a lot and my podiatrist recommends changing often depending on the miles I put. Keeps my knees and feet from hurting. So I change them about every 3-6 months running about 3-4 miles 2-3 times a week. Asics in general is my trusted brand.
"asics A nice shoe, may make you look like a Dad. If you are OK with that - then you ill be good."
"asics My feet are 11 1/2 medium, I bought a 12M, it was too short.  I reordered 12 1/2M and they fit great.  Sizing is consistently small by an entire size.  When they fit they are a great shoe.  I love my replacements."
"asics I worn newbalance for the last 4 years, but after 2 bad experiences with quality, I went back to Asics. Asics had been my go to shoe for many years and I am glad I came back! I took this pair of shoes out of the box and wore the shoes all day, they felt GREAT. In less than a week the shoes now have over 25 miles of use on them and they feel spectacular! The shoes are great quality and I highly recommend these shoes!"
asics I have big feet so I ordered these in extra wide.  When I got them I thought they would be wider than they are.  However after a few days wearing them I can say that they fit a little better.  Overall these are very good shoes and would recommend them to anyone.
"asics I'm a full time dog walker. I walk roughly 10 to 25 miles 7 days a week. After searching for a great pair I went with these. So far 8 months in and they haven't shown any signs of breaking down yet, my feet also feel relaxed when I get home. Great pair of shoes!"
"asics Purchased this item with a size fit as advertised. To my big surprise, they were too short making it impossible to wear. I liked the product and ordered bigger size not realizing that return of ""smaller"" pair item was ridiculously complex and not covered by Amazon Prime returns. More over, I had to pay $14 to ship it back.<br/>Good product but 2 stars for problems with costly return/exchange. Very disappointed"
asics Fit perfectly and look great. Very comfortable. My 3rd pair of Asics in a row
asics Im a big guy.  These are good for chilling but not for long days on your feet.
"asics They are very comfortable, but they feel a little weird at the same time.  It's almost like they're too small but they seem to fit fine.  I think it's the placement of the gel pockets.  They're placed differently than normal shoes and that may be why I think they feel weird.  But overall I like them a lot"
"asics Love, love these shoes! After reading the reviews with some saying better to order a half size up, wearing a 10.5 we ordered an 11. Need to wear thicker socks but I think the 10.5 would have been too snug. These shoes are amazingly comfortable for working out!!"
"asics My foot is WIDE and most of the shoes/sneakers doesn't come with the size I want and I usually end up getting a size or two bigger ( I am 11 1/2 but been getting 12 1/2 or 13) just to gain enough room to make it somewhat comfy, as soon as I see this one in sale (10 bucks off) and size 4E available, I just went for it. It came in two days, I put it on and it was not bad, would be better if is slightly wider but I was happy the way it is, I ran for 2 1/2 miles and it felt good. Glad to buy this and will get another pair as back up."
asics Great Shoe.  Great for wide feet. Even the regular width is wide. For extra wide feet go for the E sz.  Will need new laces as they aren't long enough.
asics Comfortable shoe. Good price
"asics Nice shoe, well made. not sure how long the glue will hold but we shall see. So far no wear after 30 miles running."
"asics I have bought ASICS shoes from stores before. Lately, I haven't been able to find one's I like and decided to try on amazon. Same great style and fit."
"asics super comfy, and light. I thrash shoes tho and so these just didnt last very long."
"asics Like hiking on air! Between these and my Outdoor Research Ultimate gaiters to keep debris out, my feet are in heaven. Thank you Asics for making a shoe with a wide enough toe to accommodate my foot as I have an extra wide! Great product!!!"
"asics As noted by some other reviewers, I also found this shoe to be too narrow. I would relate the sizing of the 4E for this shoe to that of a D width in a Nike or newbalance. For me the shoe is extremely tight. The width of the shoe is roughly 4 1/2"" at the widest point while my NB are 5"". For this i am measuring at the first set of lace holes at the tongue base to the outside edge of the shoe. When I do a flat standing measurement of my foot in this area, my foot is about 4 5/8"" with socks."
"asics I wore the shoes 6 total times and the soles started falling apart. Unfortunately, I am outside of the return window by two weeks, so I'm stuck with shoes that are defective."
"asics They're great, I'll be buying another pair just make sure you order a size larger"
asics Good value for work--not for running. Would be fine for walking around in.
"asics These shoes are very light and seem sturdy so far, however the insole padding is very thin and I had to put in an extra soft foam liner.  I don't think I'd buy them again."
"asics Great shoes.  Don't last too long, tho.  About a month or so with heavy usage."
"asics For the price, these are hard to beat as an all-around shoe for day to day office/downtown work."
"asics Great shoes , all I can was . size 15 I need a narrow  ,but this works great."
"asics They look nice, but honestly not very comfortable, wore them one time and am donating them to the church. I'm sure they will work for someone, just not me."
"asics Very pleased with my purchase!  My 4th pair of Asics, and my 1st online shoe purchase, these feel great on my feet and I was able to select the color I wanted and have them in stock and at my door in 2 days.  Very satisfied indeed.  While I'm not a big runner, I walk an average of 5 miles a day and these work for me."
asics Second time buying this style because my son loves how comfortable they are.
"asics Asics are the best running shoe and was a great deal, they last long and are great"
asics My son LOVES these and he is very picky and does a lot of running. Comfortable from first try.=
asics Second pair I've bought. Good for road running and I got plenty of miles out of the first pair. Great for the price.
asics Usually Asics mean ordering up a size.  Well not these ones. Sending back the size up for his regular size.  My bad.
asics Have not bought shoes in years. I feel like I am walking on air. Good shoes.
"asics It was time for new kicks so I bought these.  Bought then and wear them for running errands and regular use, no gym use.  This is my second pair of Asics, my first was ASICS Men's Gel-Kahana 8 Trail Runner which I bought a week before these.  I liked them so much that I decided to grab a pair of these.  I have narrow feet and the Gel Venture 5 fit well and they grip the ground very well.  No complaints here."
asics They fit a little tight. So far they seem very comfortable and they have good support.
"asics This is my husband's second pair of ASICS. We got him a pair of FILA before, which were nice... but he definitely likes the ASICS better. Very comfortable, durable, provide good breathability and support, and -- as always -- they look sporty. We use them for everyday use, but also running and sports. Overall a fantastic shoe. We're never disappointed. We also love that they come in wide sizes, since we both have wide feet."
"asics Awesome shoe.¬†<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/ASICS-Men-s-Gel-Venture-5-Running-Shoe-Black-Onyx-Charcoal-11-M-US/dp/B00NUZBZ9W"">ASICS Men's Gel Venture 5 Running Shoe, Black/Onyx/Charcoal, 11 M US</a>¬†Fit well and was very comfortable. I got the shoes Nov 2015 and am still using them and they've held up really well. I am not a big shoe buyer, I typically try to find one pair of mid priced athletic shoes like these and then stick with them for awhile. These fit that bill perfectly."
"asics I BUY THESE FOR MY HUSBAND EVERY FEW MONTHS, HES ON HIS FEET ALL DAY AS A MECHANIC AND THEY HAVE AMAZING ARCH SUPPORT WICH HELPS."
asics Great shoe for being in a lower price. Often I find the lower priced shoe to be equal to the high end shoe in comfort and wear. I have two pair of these shoes and alternate wearing them. Will order them again when the need arises.
"asics Comfortable shoe. The styling is good without being obnoxious. I wear them for work, I'm a RN that puts a lot of miles on shoes. I like that they are reinforced on the outside of the shoe where the side of the foot just behind the pinky toe meets. This is where I destroy shoes. My foot is not wide enough for a wide shoe, but wide enough to stress this part of a sneaker. I hope they last a year."
asics I bought these for my son who is very picky about his shoes. He loves them.
"asics These running shoes served me well until I invested in a more expensive pair. I over-pronate, but I felt good support in these shoes and never felt pain after frequent runs of 3-5 miles."
asics I really like these shoes for walking.<br/>I will purchase them again.
"asics Good Shoe, Great Value.  Honestly I haven't fully put them to the test."
asics These are good shoes - fit my narrow foot just fine.  Good looking too.
asics the shoes are not as comfortable as other brands of ASICS... But they are ok
"asics Very nice, consistent with all Asics I have ever had.  Usually where a 10.5 but Asics always need 11"
"asics This is my second pair.  The first pair is a year old and still working well.  These shoes seem to run small, so I ordered a half size larger than I normally wear and the fit is perfect."
asics My husband said they were the most comfortable shoes he has ever had!!
"asics great light weight shoe, that I can put on and go. 6-7 pairs off Asics"
asics I have been using it to workout for 3 months and it already has started to wear off.
asics Shoes fit and run great right out of the box. No break in. Combined with Asics active socks. :Looked at lots of other brands and styles before choosing this one. Looks like it was a good choice.
"asics Not a bad shoe for the price, but save a little more if you can and choose from the Reebok Zigtech line. I bought a pair and they're incredible."
asics Feels really comfortable to walk around in and I am picky about my shoes! I run everyday about 2 miles or Sprints and I really do like the way they look and fit. Time and Road Work will tell on their durability but for now I really do enjoy my purchase.
asics Very good. The only thing I would change is to make the toe box slightly wider.
"asics People said they ran small so I bought them 1/2 size larger, same width as normal for me, and the shoes fit great.  I've been a newbalance fan for 20+ years but they have cheaped out lately so I tried Asics and so far so good."
"asics I have never had a problem with any of the Asics I have only bought this shoe , thank you ."
asics This is a very high quality. I am extremely happy with this purchase.
"asics I thought buying a shoe online would mean giving up comfortability and fit, but it didn't at all, and was cheaper than in stores. definitely will use next time my sons shoes break down it Washington D.C."
asics Have worn Asics for years.  These are the best for casual use and for walking!  Much better than more expensive Asics models.  Good traction and good support!
asics The Right Shoe is already off the tip<br/><br/>They are not as tough as I thought
asics I have worn this brand and style of shoe for years and I adore the way they fit.<br/>They feel like a customized pair made just for me.
asics This is the most comfortable shoe I ever wore. I will buy them again in a different color and from the same seller.
"asics this is a revision.  just returned from 2 weeks vacation in london and tuscany.  these are the only shoes i wore the entire trip.  hiked and ran 8-15 miles daily including the Cinque Terre trails. also daily (5 days) ran 3 miles up/down Piazza Michelangelo in Florence.  these are the most comfortable hiking and running shoes i've owned over the past 45 years. i've bought 7-8 pairs of asics.  these are by far the best. the shoes are very supportive and soles firm which i prefer.  i'm a plodding jogger, usually 2-3 miles, or elliptical daily for 20-25 min.  these shoes firmly support my feet.  also very comfortable for general daily wear.  couldn't be more pleased with the shoes."
asics I basically buy this shoe over and over....and they always work out great
"asics Love these, great value for $50. Provide plenty of support and make me wonder why I waited so long to get new running shoes!"
asics These are the only pair of sneakers I get and the last a long time.
asics great shoe as usual..  a little firm still  but not worn it much...
asics Nice comfortable shoe for walking. Great grip even in wet and slippery conditions.
"asics Husband loves these shoes so much that he now has 2 pairs... one for ""going out"" (aka the clean pair) and another for yardwork."
"asics Again, Asics does not disappoint. The for sure tried and true sneaker that feels really good for my feet. I did order a 1/2 size larger because it didn't appear this sneaker came in a double e. Fits good, but I could have probably gotten away with my regular size without being to tight. Am still very pleased."
"asics I walk on concrete floor about 13 miles a day in a verry fast pace enviorment. I was buying 125 dollar shoes and last me about 4 to 6 months. The Venture 5 are awsome verry comparable to the 125 ones. Confortable, they breathe verry well my feet appreciate them."
"asics These were comfortable out of the box.  I liked three things<br/><br/>- They are not boring but not too LOUD like some sport shoes.. I'm a 40 year old, but I don't wanna wear shoes that make me look 65.<br/>- They are a good mix of durable and comfortable.  Seriously, like couches for your feet.<br/>- They have some minor tread for trails, but are also fine for middle distance runs.<br/><br/>*INSIDE TIP: Have the best of both worlds.  Feel like a Pop Pop, look like a Young Buck.<br/><br/>I might just buy a backup pair of these"
asics Great shoe!  My husband absolutely loves it.  This is his 4th pair
asics They fit well and don't hurt my feet after running a couple miles.
"asics Haven't had these long enough to make a real judgement yet, but I think they'll work out great."
"asics I ordered a 9 1/2 D, a size I've worn most of my life. The left shoe fit fine but the right is snug in the back. (Never had this problem before.) I've run in them a few times now and it is starting to bother my right foot."
asics Great shoe very comfortable I'm on my feet at work 11 hours a day
"asics I have a problem with my big toe, so I was not sure if they would be comfortable. I also have a wide foot and when I tried on the regular D width it seemed ok, I have only worn them twice since I got them and I am surprised that the width is appropriate for me. More time spent wearing them will be the proof. Right now, So Far So Good, no complaints... THE STYLE, THOUGH WIDE ENOUGH FOR ME DOES NOT HAVE THAT WIDE LOOK, I HOPE THEY DON'T CHANGE THIS PARTICULAR STYLE..."
asics I have a very hard time finding shoes because I have a wide foot in a half size and I don't want old man Velcro shoes! These 10.5 4e fit perfect. I wear a 10.5 2e in Red Wing and Caterpillar work boots. Other brands aren't wide enough and the half size length is too small. ASICS did it right! Will buy different styles from ASICS and that says a lot from me.
asics Gets the job done. No complaints. I think the orange makes me run faster.
"asics This is the 2nd (or 3rd) pair of these shoes my husband has bought from amazon.  He started wearing them when he got plantar fasciitis.  On weekends he works on a golf course and his foot would be killing him from all the walking.  So, he gave these a try and found them much better for support and comfort.  One pair lasrs him about a year - even with all the walking he does."
asics Very nice comfortable  shoes. Look very nice and have solid grip.
asics They're good shoes. Fit as expected. About what you'd expect in this price range.
asics Great shoes.  There is great padding all around the shoe.  The sole is sturdy.
"asics Second pair of asics that i bought, since my others got worn out, but love these shoes. They fit me perfectly and im flat footed as well as wide footed, so its hard to find comfortable shoes, but these have exactly what i was looking for, definitely buying more later on"
"asics Worn by my 20 yr old, every day. Comfortable and supportive. Durable."
"asics Perfect fit. Very comfortable, I like the heavy duty treads. So I bought another pair."
asics Had these shoes before.  This is second pair because they are awesome.  Will buy more!
asics Though not as much support as my custom molds for plantar fasciitis.. These have good support if you need soft not firm curve on your arch.. Very good shoes little impact when I run and way better grip than the champions I had. ( would slip like I had a rope jerked me sideways). Very comfortable shoe for the price but I see how long these last I have a pair of wolverines going 7+years . And hope these shoes will last
"asics I can only say good things about these shoes, I have always heard the asics where preferred by athletes, I have been of work on std due to an operation, and have been trying to walk 3 or 4 miles a day, to stay some what in shape. I am 6 foot 4 inches tall and weigh 278 pounds, so I can be hard on shoes. I walked for 2miles on a track plus all day in these, and they feel comfortable as ever..thanks"
asics Very comfortable and sturdy.  Is a great all-around shoe for me.
"asics Not quite 5 star because they aren't the best sneakers I've ever owned and I don't like running in them.  These sneakers are comfortable, stylish, and well built.  Ironically, for a running shoe I don't like running in them.  You can definitely find a lighter and more comfortable running shoe.  Thse are more of a daily wearing shoe to me.  The balance is good.  The laces stay tied with only a single knot.  They breathe well.  Overall, its a better than average shoe."
asics Excellent shoe!  Very comfortable and sturdy.  I like everything about the shoe and may purchase another pair to have on the shelf. I can wear out the sole of a shoe in three months. So far these seem to be wearing very well.
asics They look ok and seem pretty light weight but the size does seem a tad small... I'm happy with the look but concerned of how they will treat my feet.
"asics But I put these on as soon as I got them to break them in.  They were so comfortable, I forgot I was wearing new shoes.  Even with my flat feet, I was walking around all day and never gave it a second thought."
"asics Fit is pretty good, but shoe is a little rigid &amp; doesn't seem as cushioned as my Kayano 21's. May try a different model."
"asics I own a landscape business and walk 10-13 miles a day during the summer season. Over the years I have tried many different brands but the Asics over all have proven to be consistently better quality than over shoes in the same price range. The fit has always been good too. Not every pair I have had has been equal in durability as I did have one pair where the glue failed in places, but I don't really mess with other brands now as these are good shoes. I use them for the gym, and everyday life as well."
"asics The quality, comfort and construction are excellent, my one hold back of this shoe is that the toe area, although looks ventilated, is not. My feet get hot quickly and by the end of a normal shift my socks are noticeably damp. I do not have ""heat"" issues in any of my other shoes from ASICS so I would be cautious with this model if you live in a hot climate as I do."
asics Great looking shoe! Perfect length but not wide enough in the toe area.
"asics I got these in size 10.5, and they seem to run a bit small. If I were to get them again, I should say, if there's a sale again, I would get the 11.5 size instead. They seem like they are built well, they look nice, and seem to have ample arch support, however, I put my own arch support in, so this is not relevant to me.  Although the Clarks are a dress shoe, I find myself wearing these when I need to walk a long time, like at conferences or even after dinner when we walk 3+ miles with friends. It's amazing."
"asics This is the first pair of non 2000 series shoes purchased.  After 40 years and 35 marathons, knees have sent me to walking and swimming.<br/>The shoes were well made and fit just slightly smaller than the 2000 series.  They are well worth the lower price.<br/>Unlike some reviewers, no bad stitching or glue coming apart.<br/>Would not recommend this shoe for long distance running, but for walking and general use just right."
asics Great fit. Somewhat less foot cushioning than I was expecting.
asics A super comfortable shoe.  Swotching to Asic from newbalance.
"asics 2nd pair I bought from them. Durable, comfortable, lightweight, I'll buy a 3rd pair when this pair wears out."
"asics This is the first pair of shoes I got online, and I was a little nervous as to the results. But once I got these in, I loved them immediately. They fit me perfectly, and they cushion my feet well when I run. I have found my runs much more enjoyable since I got these shoes."
"asics A decent mid-priced running shoe. One can wear for everyday casual use or actually run in them! I would purchase again. They tend to fit slightly narrower than I prefer, but break in well with no discomfort."
"asics Shoes fit well, feel comfortable could use a little more support on the side of the shoe but otherwise I like them and the price is right.  I bought two pair."
asics My boyfriend is a marathon runner and he recommeds and loves them
asics Great Value great design and materials and it fit perfect for me
asics I bought them for my husband and he likes them. They fit as expected and so comfortable!
"asics Very comfortable, hopefully durable like the last pair I had."
"asics I run maybe 15 miles a week, so nothing hardcore. These shows have served well, are comfortable, and fit great. If I ran more often or had experience with other shoes, I could probably make a more informed review, but in my (decidedly amateur) opinion, these are good shoes for someone with moderate running aspirations who isn't looking to spend big bucks on a pair of good running shoes."
asics Ive had these for a few months now I think these are great shoes.
asics Comfortable to wear. Im on my feet for 8 - 10 hours a day. I wear them at least 5 days out the week.
"asics Really like these shoes.  Have good traction on the bottom.  Good support and fairly comfortable.  They are a bit stiff out of the box, but am hoping they will break in.  Seem well made.  Have mostly done cardio machines with them and have logged about 20 miles on them so far.  Have also played a few basketball games with them and they held up nicely to that punishment."
"asics Didnt fit like my earlier ASICS. I used these shoes for running and my feet started to hurt, and it wouldnt just go away. I returned them yesterday."
asics So far these fit fine and are really comfortable.  Great buy for the price.
asics there is a bit too much room in the toe area. But overall it is a good fit.
asics My second pair of this shoe they are my go to running shoes.
asics Perfect fit. Have feet issues and these shoes help where custom insoles did not!
asics Nice shoes.  True to size ordered a 10m which is my size. Only thing its a bit bulky. Its not one of those flat light weight sneakers. That's if you are looking to get something light and sleek.
asics Great shoes.  Ran a tad more narrow than most other Asics running shoes I've owned.  Should of probably got an E.
"asics Are these good for daily wear? Heavens Yes. Good for running? Hell no. These are comfortable for everyday daily use, but not at all good for every day running which I have bought for. Sole is extremely hard and doesnt give much support for run. But, on the plus side, I can say I bought a good dailywear. So, all in all, not really disapppointed. But, cpuld have been better."
"asics I have had them for a month and a half.  I only wear them occasionally, but the sole seems to be separating from the rest of the shoe.  I have never had that happen this early with a pair of Asics, even a cheaper pair, like this."
"asics I have a wide foot (4E), which has traditionally been difficult to accommodate at a reasonable price. These fit very well and look great! As a matter of fact, these are my second pair of this product. Sharp looking shoes in grey, silver and electric blue!"
asics Favorite running shoes. Had an older pair and had to get to get another!
asics Being a regular 4E user I was a little surprised when these were not as roomy as I'm used too.
asics I was able to wear them right out of the box.  They run slightly narrow which fits me perfect.  The price is great.
"asics My husband said these are by far the most comfortable shoes he's ever ran in. And they're pretty cool looking, too."
asics its tough to find a shoe for wide feet !! these are great!
"asics sent back, felt tight and traction knobs on sole felt like rocks in shoe."
asics Good sneakers for the price. Used for weightlifting. Cannot comment about running.
"asics Shoes are fine otherwise but left shoe is smaller than ordered size, men's size 10M. This is same size of all my other shoes. I can't afford to buy another pair so will have to try to live with it. Very disappointing."
"asics I bought this after reading positive reviews on it, but it didn't work for me. My legs hurt after running with these shoes on."
asics I bought these for my husband!  Only takes them off when going to sleep!
asics Finally found a shoe that my dad thinks is well worth the money. He is very happy with them.
"asics Have been wearing NB for years for the good of my feet.  I only get gray/black colors because I work with carbon. I saw these Asics and, knowing their reputation, decided to try them. I think my feet were even happier in these than the NB. Have purchased a second pair to have in stock for when the first wear out."
asics If you like asics you will like these - fit as expected.
asics Awesome. My feet no longer hurt. I ordered black but they arrived grey.
"asics My son likes it a lot! it fits perfectly, and it looks good!"
asics These are good shoes for larger guys.  They are very comfortable and seem to be built well.  I will buy another pair when the time comes.
"asics They are a bit tight in the toes, but figure they will break in."
"asics I've used these shoes for trail running, road running, cross fit and day to day use while coaching baseball.  Great shoes that come with good laces.  They last about 6 months till the cushion gives out which for the amount of use that I put them thru is pretty good."
"asics Great for running and fits me perfectly, especially because my foot is a little wide!"
asics My son LOVES these shoes. He said they were very comfortable and is showing them off to all of his friends.
asics I have the same shoes in the blue with the green accent color so they fit like my old ones I'm very happy with my purchase.
"asics awesome shoes for the cost, fit great, very comfortable"
asics Just need to break them in more and also tighten the laces.
asics These shoes are great and have a good amount of support. They fit as expected. I've taken them out a few times and so far so good
"asics Very Comfortable, and a Got them for $46 dollars, so the price was great."
"asics My husband loves them, he order two pairs, different colors!"
asics My son loves these sneakers.  He has a pair for work and another for casual wear.
asics Well made shoe .. fit very well on my block like feet ... will be buyind.... quality equal to if not better than my typical newbalance
asics Excellent Shoe...Fast Delivery.... Very comfortable...
asics These shoes have always been a great value - I usually wait for the price to dip below $50.  I cross train a combo of weights/running/general conditioning (jumprope &amp; body weight exercise) and love these shoes.
"asics I've worn other styles of asics and have never been let down, these were no exception. I have a job that requires me to be on my feet for several hours at a time, and these by far are the most comfortable. You could spend twice as much on a different brand of shoes and they might not be as good as these. I definitely recommend them and plan on buying some again when needed."
asics these shoes are exactly what i was looking for i use them to go running every morning and my shoes usually ware out pretty fast but these are holding up very nicely to my usual activity's
asics I brought these for my brother and he thinks they are great.  He said they fit just great and the width and length works well for him.
asics Good quality good price as descriped Thank you Amazon
"asics I have been using Asics running shoes for several years, and am very happy with the fit and comfort.  This sneaker is another great shoe as expected!"
asics I love me some asics.  Official shoe of chimney sweeps in America
"asics Fit perfectly.. They feel amazing. I got the 4E 11.5 which is a little wider than normal. I am a big guy. 6 foot, 210. These fit perfectly. bought these for running, and I couldnt be any more happy. Since these are low tops, i have to wear an ankle brace. Running shoes generally don't give great ankle support. So if you want great ankle support, these might not be for you."
asics They were pretty ugly in person and I returned them.
asics Very nice running shoes. They fit my wide feet well.
"asics the sole started coming loose after about four months.  I actually glued it back on, but it just progressively continued to fall off until I had to order more expensive shoes."
asics Great shoes but they lack the arch that i need for running long distances.
asics Very uncomfortable when standing or walking for 1-2 hours.  I wanted to return them.
asics Besides the shoes arriving on time and in perfect size and quality these shoes are a great help for long distance running. They have a very good grip on the terrain which gives much traction and control. They absorb most of the impact of the foot to ground collisions so your joints or feet dont wear out as quick. The only thing is i wish the soles were just a little thicker for my taste.
"asics Nice looking shoe, but I have plantar fasciitis.  my feet were killing me after walking in these shoes for a few hours.  I bought insoles and they seem to be ok now."
"asics Picked up a pair on Prime Day and am totally satisfied.  The fit was perfect.  I find myself leaning more to 10.5 over a 10 because of the width of my feet and these shoes were no exception.  The fit is great, feel is great, good support and comfort.  These runners replaced a pair of Nike runners and fit and feel much better.  Will probably switch to ASICS over Nike and Adidas from this point forward."
asics No surprises - fit and quality are typical of these shoes.
asics Good for train running/ hiking and also for mud runs
asics Fit is great and price was excellent. Most comfortable shoe I've purchased in many years. I highly recommend.
"asics Great shoe!  Great color!  Fits great, feels great!"
asics great fit and comfy. I change laces to solid black.
"asics We were so pleased to find that these shoes come in the extra wide option.  We ordered a half size bigger because my husband likes to put the extra gel insert in as he uses these all day at work detailing cars.  They are light, quick dry, supportive and fit perfectly.  Thank you!!!!!  We will be reordering these, no doubt."
"asics I've always been a 10M in ASICS.  Last pair was snugger than usual but not really small.  This pair was too small.  Either my feet have grown, or they've changed their lasts."
asics Quit my other Tennies!  Wear nothing else at work and play
"asics Very comfortable. I have plantar fasciitis and murtons neuroma, so a comfortable shoe is hard to find. No pain wearing these shoes."
"asics Normally an Adidas man, decided to give these a try. Love the look and feel of these. Might be an Asics man now."
"asics awesome shoes. very good fit, comfortable and provide good support. Are a bit heavy tho.<br/>Overall - very satisfied. Love the non-white sole which doesn't get very very very easily..."
asics I've only worn these for two days they seem to be very comfortable and fit well thank you
"asics They were a little tight, but my son still likes them."
asics This is a great shoe. Great fit and supportive for running and working out. First pair of Asics I've ever owned. I'm impressed. Have been loyal to addidas and under amour but this shoe seems better quality.
"asics Looks like a well made shoe, but it is a little narrow for the listed size. I'm only going to use these as a clean shoe to use while I'm at the gym. I won't have them on more than 2 hours at a time. After wearing around the house for about a half hour. I decided to send them back. A larger size was not available. Amazon made a refund and return very easy. I ordered a different model in a wider width. All my other shoes are 14 M. These are way to narrow."
"asics Love the shoe, just runs a little narrower in the wide width than expected.  I suggest half a size larger."
asics This is my second pair of this running shoe. Both have been.good for my feet and legs. They are a little lighter than other brands and it helps because I have cancer. Being lighter is very nice.
"asics This is my second pair, these are becoming my favorite cross training / running shoe."
asics Great shoes! Very comfy and springy. Makes me want to go running in the morning knowing that I have some nice shoes. I like the pull strap on the heel to get them on. Colors are cool.
"asics This shoe is amazing as is the price. Have been running since 1963; at that time no one ran and I would get whistled at while running in the streets of Pittsburgh, so that tells you how many shoes I have burned through. This shoe fits like a glove and after several weeks is still performing great. Size works and no movement inside the shoe. Great product."
"asics Very comfortable shoes, this is my boyfriend's 3rd pair! He goes on regular runs with them and they have been very durable."
"asics Very comfortable, great fit, and good looking shoe."
"asics Wearing them now.  Excellent fit. My daughter had some Asics volleyball shoes that lasted two seasons, so I am familiar with the quality."
asics My son had wide feet- particularly at the front of his foot.  The trouble with wide shoes with feet like these is sometimes they feel super comfy around your toes but your heels fall out of the back as soon as you move.  These sneakers were perfect for him.  No issues with heel slippage and plenty of room up front.  They definitely appear wider than a regular sneaker but he is very happy - and for a teenager you cannot ask for more!
asics very supportive and comfortable wear.  I am pleased with this purchase and Asics.
"asics From the use so far, very comfy shoes at a great price."
"asics Comfortable walking/jogging shoe, will buy again"
"asics I am so glad that Asics got into the game of making 4E shoes. The Venture 5's are light and very comfortable with good arch support and good for walking on various terrains.<br/><br/>I wore newbalance for the last few decades but in the last few years, I always have to try them on before buying since the size is no longer consistent and often run small, so I cannot buy them online. Plus the price has gone up and the quality down too much."
asics These shoes fit great - very comfortable to wear.
"asics Very comfortable shoe. It's the first time I've ordered or bought shoes online.  I normally wear a larger size in tennis shoes, so I should actually say 'fits as stated'. Great support just like most of the reviews say. I won't hesitate to order them again."
"asics My work has a casual dress code and I wear these every day at work. Some days I spend most of the day on my feet and they are comfortable. I also end up wearing them to the gym. I have no issues wearing these 8 hours at work then another 2 hours at the gym. I bought these to replace my old pair that lasted 5 years. If these hold up like the last pair of ASICS, I will be really happy."
asics Asics fit better than anything if you have a wide foot
"asics These fit like a glove and are very supportive of my feet, great price for the quality and they seem a little stiff looking when you first get em but look better once you break em in a little. These shoes are great for running, walking or anything that requires a lot of balance and or athleticism.<br/>The tread is good enough to be trail running shoes but isn't bulky."
asics Great pair of shoes I climbed a mountain in them and they worked great. I've used them hard since I got them on trails and they have worked well.
asics Length is OK but the width is too narrow for 4E
asics WANTED TO GET A 14 4E BUT THEIR SHOES HAVE A VERY NARROW TOE AREA MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAR.
asics Fit same as other asics shoes I own. Comfortable and not bad looking. Bought as walking shoes.
"asics good shoes for the price. not my running shoes, but good for all day walking around the office"
"asics Comfortable, fit as expected, seem to be well made."
"asics Great shoes, didn't even need to break them in, already comfortable."
"asics haven't wore them very much yet, but believe they are going to a good shoe, they are a good looking shoe."
"asics Comfortable shoes, quite the bargain on amazon."
"asics I normally wear a 10.5 4E and that's what I ordered for this shoe.  They fit as expected which I appreciate.  At 200lbs, I am a heavy runner so I don't want some light, airy, next-to-nothing shoe.  This shoe is substantial and comfortable and I expect that it will serve me well on treadmill, track, and trail.  If you are looking to shave another 15 seconds off of your run time, this is not the shoe for you."
asics Purchased for grandson. Fit great. He loves them
asics Reasonably comfortable for the price range. Good for walking. Better shoe strings would make the shoe nicer for running.
"asics Happy with shoe, but seem to wear out quickly."
asics Good quality comfortable shoe at a great price
"asics Second pair i have purchased on amazon.  They fit well,"
asics Was warned that they run small...did not listen.. Had to return.
"asics Fit as expected, just what I needed and delivered on-time."
"asics Overall I liked it and used for light jogging 4 days/week, but keep in mind that:<br/>- It falls apart after a year of frequent wear<br/>- Does not breathe, which also makes it hard to dry"
asics ordered 12.5 and they are somewhat tight. Nice show otherwise.
asics Great running shoes.  Won't run barefoot again.
"asics These shoes are an excellent value. They look like the Gel Nimbus and other $120+ models, but cost less than half. There's a reason for this. I've worn out well over a dozen pairs of the Gel Nimbus model over thousands of miles walking my huskies, and these are different in their construction. The foot-bed is much less padded in the forefoot and the shank is not as supportive. Additionally, the insole is little more than a piece of cardboard. Heel cushioning seems good, however. The uppers are of the same high Asics quality found in the more expensive models. The tread is pretty aggressive and is supposed to have long-wearing material. What I was looking for and got was a container for my Sole insoles, which provide the support and structure this shoe lacks on its own. After about 15 miles in these new shoes, the combination of a lower cost model and a high quality insole provides are very nice ride. There is a little less room in the toe box than in the Gel Nimbus, so a high profile insole might be a bit snug with a medium weight sock like a Vermont Darn Tough in your normal size. A medium volume insole like the Dean Karnazes Signature Series is fine."
asics These shoes are great if you walk in concrete. But the downside is concrete will demolish these shoes in 5 months
"asics little stiff, but a good shoe. Not a comfortable fit"
asics Fit as expected. Shoe is exactly what I thought it would be.
asics I got these for my partner and he loves them.
asics Ok for the price but you can tell it's a cheaper shoe when you put them on. Not as comfortable as shoes costing $20-$30 more dollars.
"asics Wow. Wore NB for years, started running as a hobby and decided to see what else was out there. Heard good things about Asics and decided to try this version because I need a wide. Very comfortable, both for walking around and for runs. Much lighter weight than my NB but still durable. Goods up fine on the trail, great cushioning and no foot pain after my 4 or 5 mile runs. All around superior shoe at a good price (went with the blue/silver for the better price and wide). Very impressed."
asics new version of a previous pair. Still good shoes.
asics Great shoes.  Fit my medium to wide foot with no issues.
"asics Wore them for 12 hours at work, a lot of walking. they were great"
asics The rubber sole started peeling off the shoe on the second month. Not good
"asics These shoes fit well, are comfortable and sturdy, plus they arrived on time as promised. Thanks!"
asics They fit great I ordered the ride I will repeat thus brand
asics These are exactly right for someone with orthotics
"asics I have become a huge fan of ASICS running shoes recently. I am 6'4"" tall, 230 lbs, with size 14 feet, and they fit me perfectly. The break in time is very quick. About a day for me and they are great. I am not a runner and only wear these as casual shoes, but I have 3 different pairs of these shoes and all of them are wonderful. I do wear a thin runners sock with them. Overall I find them very comfortable, all day."
asics I have been wearing asics for 20 years. This is a great trail shoe.  It does seem that they are making their shoes a little small lately. The pair that I bought before this one I had to go up a size so I bought this pair with that in mind.
"asics Got sick of buying newbalance every 4-6 months and hoping the size would be good enough since their products get ""updated"" all the time.<br/>Asics not only gave me a great fit for a great price.  They are sooo much more durable than the NB's.<br/><br/>I look forward to replacing these, cause I know I will have felt that I squeezed every penny of value out of them, unlike the past 2 years trying to find good value in NB."
asics Nice shoes but a little heavy for my preference.
asics I got these for work which involves several hours a day of walking and standing on a concrete floor.  These shoes seem to be as good as any I've tried and better than most for cushioning the steps.  A good deal for the price.
asics I haven 2 pairs... they both got stinky fast.
asics HUSBAND LIKES VERY MUCH AND VERY COMFORTABLE
asics get some gaiters and these are awesome for backpacking
asics very comfortable so mu so that I bought a second pair
"asics Great shoe, very comfortable for walking. I've had numerous knee surgeries and four back surgeries, I can't wear just any old shoe. This shoe is awesome and what a great price ."
"asics This is a great shoe! I bought it a few months ago, and the pair still has a lot of life left in it."
asics These tennis shoes fit perfectly to size. I am very pleased with this purchase.
"asics My boyfriend loves these shoes. It's tough to find shoes w good support in a 14 4E for a decent price. These are great!<br/><br/>We've actually gone through 1 pair, which he still uses for working in the yard &amp; such. I got him a 2nd pair that he's wearing now and then I got an extra for next year or whenever the current pair wears out. That's how much we like them!"
asics I sent them back because the toe was a bit narrow for me.
asics Asics athletic shoes in my opinion is among the best there is.  Very comfortable and the prices are reasonable as compared to other brands.
"asics Awesome shoes, same kind I had before, just newer! I thought I was getting a different brand lol. Was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box to find they were the same type and brand!"
"asics I have wide feet, but thought I ordered big enough. Didn't. Returned them. Return process was easy."
asics A nice comfortable shoe. Fits as expected. Excellent price.
asics Great value but the materials don't seem like it will last.
asics Just ok shoes. You expect better from Asics.
"asics These are my Second  pare of Asics shoes and they did not disappoint. I usually keep to pairs around, one for Jogging in and anther for casual wear until i get them broke in. they feel great on the feet and provide great support.  I work in a factory and walk on concrete  all day and these shoes make a huge difference<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Light<br/>good fit<br/>comfortable<br/>true to size<br/><br/>Cons<br/>I am not a big fan of their designs but to each his own ."
"asics fast delivery, very good quality. As expected"
"asics Exactly as expected, all met expectations."
asics I ordered the wide version. I am 6'4. 300. size 13. Fits great. Very comfortable.
"asics i hike hard 2 hrs a day , 3 days per week, they started breaking down in a month,"
asics Fit perfect. Very comfortable as I use these for the gym only.
asics My 20th pair of Asics. Best shoe u can buy
"asics Great support for this 6'6"" 240 # man!"
asics This is my first order from ASICS directly through Amazon. My foot is little bit wide. I usually order only Nike or New-balance because of my wide-foot. but I bet my bidding on this ASCIS EE size.. OMG! it fits perfect to me. It looks much nicer than the selections from local ASCIS out let mall.<br/>I would recommend this to anyone who has wide foot.
asics I NEED MORE SUPPORT FOR MY ARCH AND HEEL!!!!
asics My husband always buys ASICS shoes.  He didn't have time to shop before his trip so I just ordered these on line.  He loves them!
asics Good quality and Good fit. Will buy again.
"asics I love them, great for walking or running"
asics Love the shoes wear them when I work out.
asics Toe a little tight. Fine sneaker for gym.
"asics I bought these for my husband in 4EE, he said they were comfortable and roomy straight out of the box.  I would definitely buy this sizing again."
"asics Very comfortable, great price. Great style, padding,"
"asics I'm usually a boot guy but I bought these shoes because I needed them for work. I didn't know what to get so I looked for the runners advice, read the reviews.Excellent shoes,excellent price very comfortable. No more sore feet. Will buy again. Thank you very much."
"asics arrived quickly, looked and fit as expected"
"asics I do more indoor activities, such as Tai Chi, and outdoor activities, such as hiking and trail-walks with my Australian Shepherd than I do running, and these shoes are perfect for either and all occasions. The extra-wide width conforms to my feet perfectly, as opposed to other extra-wide shoes which I've purchased, and I am more than happy with this excellent shoe."
asics Does she was too small do to my ordering the size he actually wears a nine and a half. He actually wears A9 and a half and I ordered a size 9. Other than that the shoe was great I would recommend this product
"asics Hard to get those back home but they deliver what is supposed to deliver, nice, comfortable and excellent tread. Pura Vida!!"
asics Very nice shoes! We use the for walking.
asics Slightly tight - but very comfortable...
asics I purchased these to replace my NewBalance 610. the new NewBalance shoes don't seem to fit quite right and their design team has made some terrible choices as far as aesthetics. these Asics are great for trail running/light hiking.
"asics works as advertised, comes in handy, would buy again"
asics Overall nice shoe but the 10.5 medium fits more snugly than my other shoes.
"asics Good looking shoe they are comfortable, have gotten compliments on how they look. Very satisfied with them."
"asics These were purchased to be used as a casual shoe and I find them to be comfortable with adequate support for casual use. As such, they earn 4 stars. I don't recommend for serious distance running because lateral support is not very strong. If used for serious running, I'd give no more than 2 stars...at best. I have the previous model (Gel Venture 4) and they have held up very well over a period of 3 years."
asics Very comfortable shoes really like them.
"asics Asics makes very good shoes. I've had some great runners from Asics. I like this shoe a lot, but..I have a very small foot. I measure a mens' size 7.5 in a B width and low volume . These were pretty good around the heel but a little too wide in the forefoot and had a little too much empty room above my forefoot. I wasn't able to take up enough of that forefoot room even after popping in my inserts. I think it's a great shoe, but for Montana trails, my unfortunately small feet had to have a more snug fit."
"asics Not sure how to describe the fit of these clunkers. I believe they are my size but they just feel awful - like running in construction boots maybe. I am 5' 6"" and 135lbs with somewhat flat feet and I feel these shoes may be for big heavy guy and gals.  Truly"
asics Good looking rugged shoe that is very comfortable.
asics My husband doesnt have any complaints about these shoes..
asics Insole provided with the sneaks needs to be upgraded. With a pair of SoftSole from Dick's they feel great!
asics Good but they give serious blisters on my inner foot
"asics Outstanding!  If you are a real 4E+ get these.  I have/had too many Asics to count.  A few pairs returned because 4E does not always equal a good fit.  These do!  Better than my new NB and Sketcher 4E's.  I'm ordering more of these for the closet because it's so nice to find what fits and so frustrating to buy the exact same shoe but ""updated"" only find it doesn't fit the same at all."
asics My husband loves this brand of shoes.  They fit perfectly and we have never had any problems.  They look just as good two years later as the day we got them.  Wash in a bucket of water and air dry to keep them in shape.
asics Excellent!  Just walked 3 miles and they feel great.  I used to buy newbalance but they fell apart after a year.  Love these!
"asics I bought these for my husband, as he wears tennis shoes to work every day and wears them out quickly because they don't have enough support.  These are very sturdy - they are a trail shoe not a walking shoe.  They have much better support than what he has been wearing and will last.  I have the female version for trail running and love them."
"asics Purchased a pair last year and they worked very well. I love being able to purchase a pair of shoes that is wider than normal since I have wide feet. After using these shoes for a year, they held up well and are still usable. I purchased another pair in a different color since I have already put so many miles on the first pair and it isn't good to run in the same pair for too long."
asics Fit just right and are very comfortable when I run.
"asics Perfect shoe right out the box.  The fit was just right, I wasn't sure what size would be needed having never used this brand before but they seem to be right on target with their sizing.  Pulled them out, tried them on and went for a 45 minute run.  Felt great, good support all around with just the right amount of cushion.  First time I've ever used Asics and am very happy with them.  I will definitely be buying another pair when needed."
asics they're just fine for what my son needs.
"asics Great Hiking Walking Running shoe. Half Dome, Clouds Rest, Mt Hoffman, a great trail hiking shoe :-)  I'll buy it again."
"asics nice and light, fits good. I like em."
"asics I like them, them very comfortable. Great jogging shoe!"
"asics When I was in track and field in high school, ASICS were my go to brand for training shoes and for my shot/disc shoes.  These Gel Venture 5's feel great and hopefully will last like the ones I had all those years ago."
asics I have never been disappointed with ASICS products through Amazon.
"asics This is about my 5th pair of these, the bottom wears out on me because I walk on Brushed concrete all day.  That is not to say the bottoms are cheap they are not and hold up longer than most under the conditions I put them through.  Great shoes, will continue to buy them as long as they are sold."
asics Third pair in four years. Great shoe and gives me about 1800 miles per pair. Everything wears well but the soles finally wear down to where they need replacement.
"asics Great shoe. This is my third pair of the 5's, and I had a couple pairs of 4's before. Good fit, excellent cushioning, very light, and good value for the money. Personally, I think the G-V 5's may be the best looking running shoe out there; I use them for casual wear when they're new, before I put them into my exercise rotation.  Highly recommended."
asics Good sneaker for the price. Very comfortable.
"asics Another great pair of running shoes! I've been wearing ASICS for about 3 years now, and the Gel Venture 5 running shoes are great. I've had this pair for a couple of weeks now, but so far, another great pair of ASICS. They're very comfortable shoes. I wear them walking, running and biking, and I really do like them. They fit as expected, and they look good too. I'm glad I ordered these, and I'm very happy with them. I would definitely recommend them to anyone interested."
asics Super comfortable show! Seriously considering a second pair!
asics Choose 4E plus 1/2 size larger for wide feet
asics Great shoes. Boyfriend loves them. He has serious ffeet issues and has found these shoes comfortable and supportive.
asics Very good fit and outstanding price.
"asics I have been wearing these shoes since I began my 5K training (abt a month). Very comfortable to wear. They hold up great on the trail. I could have used one size bigger, but that was my call. Recommended for the quality and price"
"asics I like jogging in these shoes. They appear to have a little more comfort and shock absorption then I expected.<br/>To preface this comment, I jog 1 mile 2 to 3 times a week only."
asics I normally wear a men's 8 got a 9 and they fit perfectly.
asics The quality of this running shoe is noticeably better than my other running shoes.
"asics I have purchased multiple pairs of these shoes over the last several years.  I use them for running occasionally and for working around the house.  They fit and wear comfortably for either use, whether I am walking behind the push mower, tilling in the garden, weed eating or taking the occasional run in the neighborhood."
"asics Love this product, is as described."
"asics Great shoe, replaced my old running shoes"
"asics Nice shoes!  Fit true to size, would buy again."
asics Comfortable shoes for long-distance running
asics They were a gift and he loves them.
"asics Always been a fan of ASICS whether it's for running outdoors or for simply working out in the gym. These shoes needed to be broken in a little for me, but might be different for others. The ones I had prior also felt lighter, but I think it's because I broke them in. Still for every day use and for the average person, at this price, I recommend getting a pair."
asics Love Asics shoes! This is my second pair of the same model. About 25% cheaper than if I bought them locally. strongly recommended.
asics Highest quality. Excellent sneakers. Great deal.
asics A gift for a nurse who is on his feet lol day. He loves them.
asics Bought these for my boyfriend. He does a lot of walking for his job and needed some real comfortable shoes- he loves them!
"asics Second time I have purchased this shoe.  Well made, rather durable for a sneaker, and fits arch support insoles.  Most importantly it comes in wide widths with a variety of sizes at a normal sneaker price point.  Unfortunately this is rare. I've shopped quite a bit for wide width shoes and these are superior to other brands including newbalance and Puma."
asics Premature wear and seam separation.
"asics Good looking shoes, mostly quite comfortable, but seem a bit smaller than the other 10M's I have worn. They will be fine with summer socks, but nothing thicker. If I order them again, I will try a half-size larger."
asics Great Fit.  Very comfortable.  Recommended Buy.
asics Great running shoes for the price.
asics Great running shoe and nice price.
asics Very comfortable like you would expect from an ASICS shoe.  This has become my casual shoe of choice.
asics had two pairs left on both fit bad
asics Very comfortable and essentially required no break in.  I require a wide shoe and these fit perfectly in the 4E width.  I keep in a list various shoes that I know work well for me (newbalance and ASICS) and keep checking back for better pricing.  These were at a great price so I bought 2 pair and definitely do not regret that decision.
asics Good shoe for daily cross training. I use it for weight lifting and running.
"asics Been using the shoes for about a week now and all I can say is that I'm loving these shoes. I use it for work and it's very comfortable to walk on. I gave it a bad rating for good arch support but that's only for me due to having flat feet. The shoes are comfortable enough with the stock insoles in them but once I put my custom orthotics inside, the shoes became much more comfortable and I'm able to stay on my feet longer."
asics The color wasn't the one I expected but will suffice. They were bought a size and a half bigger than I wear to allow for my socks and we're still tight without my walking sox. I've worn them every day now and gladly they seem to be conforming to my feet better. Still to snug and I hope it doesn't cause premature fabric fatigue on them. Cushion is good and arch support is adequate so they seem quite neutral on my feet.
"asics I am an Asics fan, but this shoes had a tough sole and i feel un comfortable. I describe it as you are walking on pins. Creating pain to my feet. I bought this blindly because of the reviews over here. I have a fleet feet and usually i am feeling comfort with Asics gel Kayanoo and excite.But this Venture 5 model, i am not happy with the performance"
asics Pretty great shoe. I figure a five star review is pretty much a custom shoe or one that just caresses your foot right out of the gates. This doesnt quite hit that mark but is generally sturdy and attractive. I felt there was not a lot of arch support. Mine are pretty high though. Got about 15 miles on em so far and they are getting comfy and holding up. Good quality I expect from this brand.
"asics I tried these shoes on in a store, so I knew what I was going to be getting, but the sizing is the same as any other ASICS shoes. These are very comfortable shoes, and they are holding up very well after a few months of wear. ASICS are some of the best shoes you can buy if comfort and support are your primary concerns, and they look good as well. I will never buy anything else as long as they continue to make shoes of this quality."
asics These fit me well. Some 9s are too small for me. These are perfect  Would buy again. Good arch support also
asics Very comfortable shoe.  Saved about $10 over what I had found them for in any store.
asics So far so GREAT. I really like them. Hopefully they last.
asics Fit perfect.  I have neuropathy and need shoes that cushion my feet to relieve the pain.  These shoes perform admirably.
"asics fit okay, is a comfortable shoe-"
asics Great quality shoes. Looks nice.
asics Very comfortable and light weight.
asics Fit as expected pretty stable &amp; comfortable.
asics Great fit great color would buy again
asics Good shoe. Young man seems happy with them.... stands at his job for 5-8 hours and hasnt come home complaining that his feet hurt.  They do not have the  non-skid soles but they seem to work in the kitchen area.
asics Comfortable made well look good
asics Very good and comfortable tennis shoes.
asics Best product and cheap in price
asics Really fits well and they're comfortable!
"asics My son is hard to buy shoes for, so we went to the shoe store and tried on many shoes.  He decided on these and they didn't have his size so we came home to find them online.  He has been very happy.  He is a college student that walks a lot during the day and his feet are comfortable.  He will most likely replace them with the same shoe when these are worn."
"asics I purchased these for my husband.  They fit him as expected, and were very attractive in coloring."
"asics I try not to give a 5 star unless its a great product. I bought these because they were on sale. I am glad I did and once I put them on when they got to my house (fast shipping by the way) I went to try and order more because of the Christmas sale and they were all out. I work as an auto technician and on my feet all day on concrete, I have learned to bye good shoes or my back kills me. These shoes are great shoes! Thank you ASICS!"
"asics Great fit, comfortable and look good as well"
"asics Very comfortable. I do not have a great deal of miles on them quite yet but, so far so good."
"asics I definitely recommend adding 1/2 shoe size to whatever you normally wear, when ordering these. Or, at least that is what I should have done. Might also consider the wider width product ?"
asics Good shoe; fit is as expected.
asics nice shoes but never in stock!
asics great wearing shoe. I have reordered this on several occasions
asics Nice fit and very comfortable.
"asics Just what I needed, great fit, comfortable"
"asics Good pair of shoes, but wears out so fast."
asics A good solid shoe that is comfortable and fits true to it's size.
"asics After trying 4 different styles of Nike shoes I finally found these.  These are more comfortable than any of the newer Nike options plus in the wide width there is plenty of room for my EEE size feet. I've been wearing these every day for a couple weeks now and they seem very durable and well made.  I would highly recommend these shoes for anyone,  especially those with large feet!"
asics Incredibly comfortable and true to the size shoes. Ordered in 8.5 d(m) and it fits my 22.5 cm foot just perfectly. Below is the pic of the Reebok Crossfit Nano 5 next to it.
"asics Great fitting shoe, very comfortable and great support.  Looks great too"
asics Very comfortable and seem to be holding up well!
asics My husband loves these shoes.
asics love these shoes!!  very comfortable!!
"asics Very comfortable shoe, alleviates plantar fasciitis pain very much!"
"asics Good shoes, recently began to run further distances and needed actual running shoes. Good shoes fit nicely and are not too light nor heavy. I do wear inserts for my feet so I took out the stock and replaced with mine and they fit in alright not the best but over all good. Can't get something perfect but for now it's close enough. My running it self got better I feel my stride is better!"
"asics Might be a half size smaller than what I would typically get. Nice, comfortable shoes though. If I were to change anything, it would be to get darker laces, as they are very bright blue. Other than that, the shoes are very good quality for the price."
asics This is my second pair of this model.<br/>The first pair gave good service until one of the soles parted from the shoe. It appears the glue let go.<br/>I decided to try one more pair and if the same thing happens I will no longer purchase his brand
"asics Fits as expected, comfortable to me, replaces my last pair of same model, was happy with enough to buy another pair."
asics Feel like I'm walking on air!
"asics I buy Asics runner all the time, the only brand I buy because they normally fit perfectly and are a well engineered shoe. These ones however are not runners or well engineered, these are fashion shoes and not for anything serious.  As for fashion shoes I will give them a pass, not bad looking.  As for running shoes, they are not."
asics I have a bad hip. This shoe helps.
"asics Nice shoe, I would buy again."
"asics Very, very wide. Will be returning."
asics Caught on sale! Great shoes!
asics My husbands first pair of asics and he is hooked!!
asics Comfortable. No aching feet.
asics Nice looking and comfortable.
"asics Very comfortable, great fit."
asics Excellent fit and comfort.  These shoes provide the exact arch and ankle support I have been needed with excellent cushion.
asics Very comfortable and worth every penny. These fit true to size.
"asics Best shoes for the money I've ever had, this is my second pair and will be buying a third and fourth."
asics Excellent shoes!  I'm glad I read the reviews about the sizing before I ordered them.  I normally wear a 12D.  I ordered these in a 12.5 4E and they fit perfectly.  Super comfortable and they appear to be typical Asics quality.  Another plus is that they're just grey and black - no crazy colors or patterns.  I got them with a 20% off coupon so they were less than 40 bucks.  Can't beat that for a very solid and comfortable pair of shoes.
asics This is nun second pair. Love them
"asics Comfortable shoes for the price, however I'm having issues with the tread peeling off the bottom of the shoes. However, I think this might be my own fault for dragging my feet. A spot of superglue seems to hold the tread in place."
asics Very comfortable shoes.  Excellent for flat feet.
"asics Really nice shoe, great fit!"
asics Bery comfortable will buy again
asics great fit for me.....good price...a good buy for me
asics Great sneakers. They last and last and great ortho support.
"asics I have been getting this style Asics for years with different numbers and titles. They all feel about the same to me. Asics always fit small, so instead of a 13, I usuualy go with the fourteen since I use custom othotics and a brace on one foot.  Asics alwya seem to fit my foot better than other brands.<br/>These, although acceptable,do not feel like their top-of-the-line shoe."
asics second purchase of this great item
asics Thankfully they fit and are comfortable.
asics I've worn Asics for decades now. These shoes are as good as expected.
"asics I have a wide foot and these shoes fit perfectly and are comfortable and light weight. This is the second pair that I have owned and I will be ordering another soon, great shoes."
asics Very good quality and fit.
asics Great deal and comfortable too.
asics very very comfortable and looks good
"asics Very good shoe; the gel and arch support are very welcomed for these tired sore feet !; They are a little narrow but that is good, they have good support and I know they will stretch some as they wear in; just don't get a smaller size then you need. I also wear a little thicker sock, wicking and cushioning. Good price too, why pay $100 ++ for a shoe that is no better ?"
"asics Great shoe for the money but even though I owned practically the same model of Asics shoe in size 12 for 15 years, the new shoe has to be bought in size 12.5.  Side by side the 12.5 is still a mm smaller or so still.  Weird, but after some dealing with Amazon, all is settled and it is a great shoe.  Fits my foot type better than Nike."
asics They are great running shows according to the husband. He's pretty solid and tells me shoes are very light compared to his old running shoes. I feel that it gives him the right amount of cushion and pressure support for his weight. He's 5'6 and about 220lbs and I think these shoes are going to get some miles on his journey to weight loss. He wears them during casual outings as well!
asics Comfortable and inexpensive shoes.  No problems so far.
asics Great sneaker! Husband is happy and is on his feet all day working at a fitness center.
asics I had never heard of ASICS shoes but I did some research and found them highly rated. I walk a lot so good shoes are very important to me.These are advertised as running shoes but I find them to be very good for walking. These are light weight and breathe well. They are very comfortable to walk in. Next time I will try the walking shoe.
"asics Love Asics shoes, just wish that lasted longer."
asics Next time I will get the Wide.
"asics I got these because they are very light and wear very well.  There is good arch support.  The shoes are very comfortable.  I walk 3 to 5 miles a day on sidewalks and asphalt and the shoes last a minimum of 6 months before they begin to show wear.  I normally find the shoes in a store, try them on for fit and comfort then I know the correct size.  I liked these so well I ordered another pair, different color combination.  Really comfortable with great support."
asics These were a gift for my husband. He says the shoes are comfortable and fit well.
"asics Great walking shoes, nice insole with arch &amp; heel support"
asics I'm not a runner but purchased this shoe and the nimbus 17 to help with a foot injury. I replaced $50 nike's and I believe the Asics work better for my foot. They also offer the wider shoe size 4E which means I can buy a 9.5 4E instead of a size 10 nike to fit my wide foot. I'll probably purchase another pair of the Gel Venture 5's although the foot padding is not as comfortable as the Asics gel nimbus 17 but the Venture's are only 1/3rd of the price.
"asics I am a fan of ACICS and these are perfect for daily wear.  I an not able to run any longer (hip) but I still walk at least 10,000 steps each day and find these to be very comfortable."
"asics Shoe fits and looks great, but the piece of rubber that extends to the front of the shoe from the sole has detached on my left shoe after only a few weeks of wear.  Other than that, it is a great shoe."
asics Very comfortable and supportive
asics Fit perfect my son love it
asics I don't buy sneakers very often. I did some research and decided to purchase these after monitoring the price for a couple of months. I'm used to dress shoes and flat-soled shoes and decided to purchase some running shoes for when I exercise. These are so comfortable that I've ditched my flat-soled shoes and wear these instead. Very happy with this purchase.
asics Great shoes for running!
"asics Unlike my previous pair of Asics (also reviewed on Amazon), this pair was great right out of the box. I have difficulty finding shoes that fit correctly, even more so without a lengthy break-in period. This pair fit very well the first time I put them on. After a few more days of wear, the fit is just about perfect.<br/><br/>Comfort and support for these shoes is great. I can wear them all day long with no issues at all."
asics the insides at the heel dont last.
asics Great shoes for walking or running.
"asics Great value, very comfortable shoe!"
asics Fit well. Great walking shoe
asics nice shoe.  I have a somewhat narrow foot and wear a 15 in nike but 14 in asics.
"asics I had to open up the laces a bit to get a comfortable fit, but I like them."
asics bit smaller than advertised
asics I bought these shoes for myself but they were too tight for my feet. I need wide shoes and these will be a super pain for people with wide feet. I ended up giving these to my father who absolutely loves them for daily use. He realized a lot of stress and back pain was relieved from these shoes because of the good support. He has to walk a lot because of public transport.
asics Great shoe for the price.
"asics Husband hates these shoes. Really uncomfortable. Bothers his knees and ankles. We are past the ""breaking in stage"". He has been wearing them for 5 months now."
asics Fits well. Well constructed. Lasts long time.
"asics Well made, comfortable."
"asics I love these shoes, the wide fit was an absolutely perfect size for me. I bought them to be able to walk around Las Vegas and Disneyland all day, and they do NOT disappoint! My foot pain has gone WAY down when walking for extended periods of time when wearing these. The material is good for breathing, and I have no regrets with this purchase."
"asics Great fit, sturdy shoes"
asics great shoes very comfortable
asics These shoes are the best!
asics Good quality and true fit.
asics My husband loves these expect daily use for 6 - 9 months then replace
"asics This is my second pair of Asics walking shoes. The insoles feel perfect, and the material is sturdy for the long haul."
asics There was no discernible difference between my size 10 and this size 10.5 shoe.
"asics they're ok, I guess.  What I was amazed with was the amazon size calculator where it asks you your current model shoe and size and translates it what size you need to buy in this model shoe.  I was skeptical as it told me to get an 11.5 4E (when I usually wear at least a 12 or a 12.5 2E).  I took a chance and trusted it, and was glad I did because it was right on the money.  Pretty amazing.  Back to the shoe, accommodates my orthotics well, just doesn't seem like there is enough built-in support from these shoes even with the orthotics in.  I am normally a brooks beast wearer and devotee, but got a little tired of the price of the ""beast"" and the seemingly limited availability in my needed size.  Thought I would give these a shot since they are so highly rated.....they are no beast though I can promise you that.  Will probably be able to use for exercise and walking, but will not stand up to a 12 hour shift in the ER like my beasts do.<br/><br/>REVISED 12/4/2016:  I initially gave these three stars, have now updated to five.  I have grown to love these shoes, especially for the price.  I had been primarily using them for work-related endeavors stepping down from a Brooks Beast to these and initially I wasn't too impressed.  As time has passed, and these shoes have withstood the test of time, I have really come to appreciate them.  They have held up well (no visible signs of wear actually in spite of daily use) and really shine in more athletic endeavors.  Good for work and for walking and running and averaging $40/pair, and lasting a significant period of time, really what more can you ask for?  I just bought another pair, I guess that's what!!"
asics Excellent shoe.  Very comfortable right out of the box.
"asics This is my second pair of these ASICS. I walk about 5 miles a day on trails and pavement and the 1st pair lasted over 6 months.  Very comfy, durable shoe.  For a pair of shoes that's under $50 you just can't go wrong.."
"asics Have been using these for the last two weeks. What can I say?! These are amazing. I just wanted some cheap running shoes that I could use for a couple months before buying another pair for the summer. I am floored, these are really nice quality and feel very durable. I have already put in close to 50 miles on them and they are holding up well. I would say they are better for trails and the road since they have a little less traction, but I have no problem running on the treadmill with them. It has great padding and doesn't hurt my knees or ankles when running long distances in these. Highly recommend for someone who is looking for some affordable yet quality shoes."
asics Exactly what was described
asics I really like these shoes. They fit well and are sturdy for walking and the trails. I have an older pair that lasted for years.
asics Great shoes.  As advertised.
asics I am very picky about my running shoes and I have found the ASICS gels to be one of the most comfortable out there! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these to anyone.
asics sneakers are quite heavy and not really the best for running.
"asics I'm usually a fan of ASICS.  I run regularly a couple of times a week (~10K).  Normally I don't have problems with new pairs, but these pair immediately felt narrow and caused me blisters on both feet."
asics Comfortable and cool.  I love these shoes.
asics Good.  Need better inserts.
asics Great shoes and comfortable
"asics I have always been a customer of newbalance by virtue of the brand's ready availability of shoe widths of 4E, so I really hadn't considered another manufacturer. Wish I had now, because newbalance quality isn't what it used to be. These however are just what the doctor ordered. I walk six to eight miles daily and couldn't be happier. Fabulous fit and support, lots of ""cush"", and just an overall comfortable.shoe. I would highly recommend!"
asics More sturdy than the Gel-Nimbus which makes it much better for the gym but a bit heavier/stiffer for the road with less airflow.  Slight discomfort towards the front seams but after a week it was less noticeable.  For running I think I'll get another pair of more expensive Gel-Nimbus and continue to use these for the Gym.
asics If your size is typically US8.5 then order size nine.  Happy with these shoes.
asics Very happy with these shoes...
asics Was too narrow for my hubby but still very nice shoes.
"asics This is my third pair of Asics running shoes that I have owned. They are very comfortable. I use them for walking rather than running and a pair lasts me for 4 to 5 years. The fit is snug, but they break- in after a week or two of daily wear."
"asics I would buy this shoe again, if I had more feet."
"asics fell apart within two months of moderate use. the sides lining came loose on both shoes, leaving a sharp plastic structural part open to tear my foot apart. normally have good experiences with asics, but these were a huge let down."
"asics I ordered these because I've been having trouble with my feet and thought these would help. They are comfortable. Showed to my Podiatrist. He says they are not a good brand, something about not having a ""Shank"" in the sole. He recommended 4 different brands. I'll keep them and wear as spares with support inserts."
"asics nice shoes, good deal"
asics Great set of shoes for walking the dog!
"asics The shoes fit fine and they seem durable enough. My only issue with them is that they seem a bit slippery on wet surfaces, and that makes running fast in the rain a bit scary."
"asics These fit perfectly! Very, very comfy. Have worn these twice a day for running and lifting for about 4 months now and they have held up really well--they still look brand new."
asics Shoe has been wonderful - great price and seems durable - happy with purchase
asics Works great. Good fit.
"asics So far so good, they fit good and are comfortable."
"asics Appear to be good quality - purchased for someone else.Don't ever see him wear them, cannot comment further."
asics Love these shoes. This review comes after 5 months of use. I would buy these again
asics Fits great and price was great too
"asics love them, great shoes"
"asics Hard to give a $50 trainer a 5 star rating, but in the end, comfort is the key and ASICS never lets me down. Great shoe for the price!"
asics I wear these shoes mainly walking/running on treadmill and they are great. A little tight at first but after a few days of use they fit great.
asics Comfortable fits great good quality shoe
asics Fits well and looks good!
asics Very supportive arches!
asics This is my second pair.
"asics I have used asics shoes for about 15 years now and there is no better,thanks"
asics This shoe is nice.  fits well and is great for walking and easy hiking.
"asics Great sneakers! Fit perfectly! Great arch support! I constantly have a problem with my arches and these sneakers have great arch support. They are super comfortable, land look great. These are my gym sneakers. I wear them while working out, and if i'm gonna run on the treadmill. Great price and was very impressed by the fit, look, and comfort. Highly recommend for the great price!"
asics great product and price
asics Excellent shoe for long walks at speed.  I cover 6-8 miles at a time over blacktop and stone trails at a quick pace [13:00-13:30 minute/miles average].  This shoe required no breaking in.  I had no hot spots at all never mind blisters.  I figure I have over 250 miles logged on this pair already.  I think it's good for at least another 150 miles or 5 weeks.
"asics 2nd pair. These are my everyday PT shoes, will buy a 3rd pair when the time comes"
asics Great shoe. Good deal
"asics At first they felt snug and comfy, but after the first day they began to really hurt the insides of my feet.  Felt like you were walking on the hard side of the shoe.  Exchanged for a wider size and will see if that fixes it."
asics Excellent shoes!!!!
asics Husband loves these
asics great running shoes
"asics Now these pair feel good!  Again, $120 is a bit high, so let's see how long they last."
"asics Cormfortable, light, cool and great for walking."
asics These shoes are great and fit well.
asics Good sneakers for the money.  A+
"asics Light weight, good fit"
"asics So comfortable and a great shoe!! Highly recommend these to anyone. My husband has diabetes, and his feet hurt, but this shoes work great for him!"
"asics My shoe of preference for 30 years has been Asics. But over the past decade I have seen this brand bridge into a wide spectrum of shoes that no longer respects the roots that made them successful.<br/><br/>Asics (like many competitors) have a wide range of bad cheaper shoes, to over priced higher end kicks.<br/><br/>This ""trail shoe"" feels like the Blur 33s I mistakenly purchased a few years back with heavier treads. They have a soft cutiony ride, but over a few weeks of breaking in, feel like they could slip off my feet given the terrain got muddy. And they are heavy shoes as well.<br/><br/>I feel confident on flat trails, but on a rapid decline where grip is key, I don't trust them as much as other brands. That, and the looser fit that has occurred since breaking them in had my toes banging the front of the toe box on steep downhills.<br/><br/>I would wear these for the mild beaten sort of trail that loops around a reservoir, but won't be wearing them for the Ragnar Trail race I have in a few months.<br/><br/>In a market with so many more serious running brands, it looks like my 3 decade relationship to Asics is coming to an end."
asics Great running shoes
"asics Fit great, delivered as expected."
asics Comfortable shoe!!
"asics Solid running shoes. Not with much ventilation, but would make perfect outdoor running shoes. Highly recommended."
asics Very nice.....enjoy the running again.
asics A good shoe for light trail running.
asics Goto Kickaround Shoes.
asics Fit is great!  Support is good.  Really like them.
"asics Practical,  economical for me."
"asics bought for my son, he likes the feel. thank you"
asics The sole of the is really hard and uncomfortable. I got pain in my calf while running. Would not recommend
asics Very comfortable...
"asics These solved my wide feet problem for the 4EE width was hardly available.  I'd replaced the insoles with the ones that were more of the arch support and now I can run and walk all day in these.  It looked dark in all which hid the dirt well, but the deep blue laces are a bit too dark for me... thinking of replace them, too, for lighter colored ones.  Overall. I'm satisfied with this purchase; and , of course, the price was hard to beat."
asics Meets my expectations.
asics Great price as compared to brick and mortar stores in my area. They fit snug and will feel better as they stretch upon wearing a few times.
"asics Love this shoe! Fits perfect and looks great!  I wore Tiger Asics back in the early 70's when I was stationed in Japan, loves that this is available!"
asics Just as described
asics FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!
asics Very comfortabler
"asics Nice shoes, but the trail running soles were not as comfortable as I expected. I have worn Asics for many years."
asics The product is well made.  It was meant to replace the same kind of shoes I've been using and well worn at that.
asics Looks feels great
asics Perfect running shoes.
asics Great athletic shoe
"asics These were purchased for my son.  He goes through shoes pretty quickly and these seem to provide pretty good cushioning for the walking that he does,  The wide size makes it more comfortable for him which can limit the selection.  But he likes the style and color and found that Asics tend to provide the most comfort during the entire day.  I always look to purchase Asics when the time comes."
"asics I'm a woman with wide feet. I find these shoes to be very comfortable. They have a nice snug fit, which I like. They don't ride up on the heel. Nice cushion feel when walking around my tile floors and on walks. My knees don't ache and I don't have my usual Plantar Fasciitis pain. I recommend these shoes for a wide foot."
asics feels good for 50
asics Best shoes ever.
asics Very comfortable
asics Fit good great style.
asics very comfortable
asics Awesome product!
asics Shoe fits perfectly.
asics Love the colors.
asics A nice shoe !!!'
asics Good shoe for the money
asics Exceeded expectations
asics This is a relatively inexpensive shoe but it is comfortable and appears to be well made. It is not quite as light as I hoped it would be.
"asics Bought these for my boyfriend to wear when he rides his scooter. He loves them. And he wears them everywhere bc he doesn't want to get his ""nice"" nikes dirty. Haha. They're a great comfortable and supportive show with lasting durability. He loves them. He's a 10.5 and I bought a 10.5 and they fit perfectly"
"asics Buy  size 8 4E, this shoes absolutly comfortable for my feet, usually use NB 8.5 2E. Tried to walk And run in wet soil track, gel venture 5 give me feel safe and well balance. The grip do well in wet and dry condition. So far I'm very happy with ASICS Gel Venture 5<br/>Agreed with other reviewer who give 5 Stars."
asics After getting extra wide I still feel these are a little snug.
asics Asics makes a comfortable shoe. Well worth the price compared to other shoe manufacturers.
"asics Just as described, hubby loves them"
asics Pretty good shoe - fits well too.
"asics No complaints, been a week"
asics Comfortable but not the most attractive looking shoes.
asics Best set of shoes ever!
asics I got a pair at a local store in the silver color. They did not have the color I wanted. I found the same shoe on Amazon in black. Perfect! The silver ones I wear casual and the black ones to work. I'm on my feet all day. The wide width and high arch fit excellent.Running shoes have high arches. I need the high arches for the shape of my feet. This corrects my foot alignment and my knee and back pain go away.
asics Liked the shoe but it ran small for me. Had to return it.
asics Comfortable shoe
asics Title says it all!
asics Excellent walking shoe - very stable and comfortable.
asics They look great but medium was way too narrow for me.
asics These shoes are even nicer and better than I expected!!!!!<br/>AWESOME SHOES... AWESOME SELLER!!!!!
asics great product!
asics Nice shoes. Well made..
asics Item as described.
asics awesome thanks
"asics Bought in early July 2015<br/>I bought this shoe to replace my standard newbalance's.  I wear them for work for an average of 9 hours every day.  Most of witch I am standing.<br/><br/>Pros: Very Comfortable, quiet while walking,great fit<br/><br/>Cons: EXTREMELY SLIPPERY on wet floors (dangerously)<br/>  Rubber coming off off the toe ends of both shoes.  Nov 2015<br/>  Sole starting to come away from bottom of shoes. Nov 2015"
asics Fit great. Built well.
asics This shoe is very good.  I run from 4 to 10 miles on a particular run and run 3-4 times a week.  They work well and I have limited pain in my calves and feet.  That is the main point for me.  So I would have to say buy them if you like good shoes that work.  The are pretty much in line with any other Asic shoes.
asics Exactly what was pictured and ordered.  Thank you
asics I switched over to Asics quite a while ago because they are more comfortable and durable than Nike. These shoes are no exception. The only complaint is the the soles are a little firmer than what I'm used to getting in a pair of Asics shoes. Still I have size 15 feet and these fit perfectly and wear very comfortably.
asics Great shoe for a good price
asics I liked this so much I bought a second pair two years later.
asics Everything was great
asics I have plantar fasciitis and these shoes feel great.
asics good sneakers
asics As described.
asics They are good but they are not running shoes.  Just good for walking.
asics Excellent shoes
asics Our second pair of these in a row. Perfect for my 14 yo son's basic needs.
"asics I buys these for my son.  He runs track and field/Cross Country.  He is very much flat footed and we've tried many different shoes.  He absolutely loves these shoes.  No pain, runners toe, stress fractures, leg pain.  Very much satisfied and happy with results.  Also, shoes last about 6 months before breaking down.  That is AWESOME for a daily runner that puts in about 8 miles daily 6 days a week."
"asics My Husband got these for running, hes very happy with them and says they are comfortable, they wear well, and support his arches, and that they have a good grip while running. They fit as they were meant to fit. My husband is extremely picky and usually won't get shoes online because of this, I took a chance getting a brand he ALWAYS gets and they were a hit."
asics As advertised
asics Great purchase
"asics The quality of the shoe is good considering the price point. My only issues with the shoes are that the arch is a bit high for my feet [makes it a tad uncomfortable, can't wear for long periods of time] and the shoes don't breathe well. Be sure to put some sweat absorbent powder in the shoes before a long day."
asics Comfortable!
asics Good product
asics great thanks
asics Nice sneaker
asics Great fit and very comfortable.  This is my hubby's second pair
asics Good Shoe :)
asics I like Asics products and this is no exception.
asics Replaced the exact same shoe
"asics Great shoe!  I'm a huge ASICS fan from running in school, but they always leaked because they breathed so well.  These are a little heavier and very solid. I CAN run in these because they are so comfortable but they make my feet sweat really bad because they don't breath.  As far as rain or trail running,  puddles are no longer a fear.  I can splash in puddles and my socks stay dry. Great day to day shoe for all occasions."
"asics I have duck feet. Narrow at the heels, but really wide at the toes. Women's shoes only come in narrow, regular and wide. And there isn't much to choose from in the wide. Not that it matters, it's not very wide anyway. So for a long time now, I have been wearing shoes that are too tight. I got these in a mens 4E, which is something like an extra wide. And they fit! I can wiggle my toes, and the side of my feet aren't being squished. They lace far enough up that I can make them tighter around the ankle, so the heels do not slip, either. I also have high arches. I could feel the arch support when I put them on, but it did not cause pain even after wearing them for 8 hours the first time. Most of those 8 hours was on my feet, and even toward the end of that, my toes were not uncomfortable. After taking them off, I didn't have foot cramps from my shoes being too tight, either. Can't believe I waited this long to get these.<br/><br/>I've looked at, and had, other 4E shoes in the past, and I just can't see what the makers are thinking. Usually, they are much heavier than a regular shoe, and often don't breathe at all either. These are not heavy, and breathe well. After spending the day cleaning the garage in 90¬∞ weather, my feet weren't sweaty. Well, not more than you would expect for the weather, and never did my feet feel hot."
asics Great shoes!
"asics I have flat feet and am on them all day long. These are great on my feet, great value, and I have gotten several compliments on them."
asics These are great!
asics a tad narrow
"asics Good looking shoe, fits great arrived on time, packaging was very good"
"asics The shoe runs about a half size small in length...so a 11.5 fits like an 11 in other shoes. I was not surprised by that, but was surprised by the width, which also runs about a letter less than expected. I am hopeful the width will loosen up a little with wear. I do like asics and my prior pair was excellent."
asics Comfortable and light..
asics great shoes
asics Great value
asics Nice shoes.
asics comfortable
asics Nice shoes.
"asics This is my second pair, the shoes are comfortable and hold up well."
asics positive comments continue since April 2017
"asics At first they hurt my feet, but after wearing them off and on for a couple of weeks, they feel great now. No pain, just a break in period, at least for me. I use them for work, in which I stand for 8-12hrs a day on my feet. So comfort was a big part of my decision for purchasing these. I would suggest them to anyone."
"asics I wear Saucony Kinvera 5,6 &amp;7 and NB. For both these shoes, my 8.5 U.S. size turns out to be much bigger for Asics. Had to go a size down by .5 for a proper grip."
asics Really nice love it
asics My husband really liked it! Loved the color and it's comfort!
asics great shoes
"asics I had a hip replacement surgery 2 months ago and I needed a shoe with stability, cushioning and support for my therapy, this was it!"
"asics I have slightly wide feet, and this is one of they few shoes that fits me well. I've gotten the same model for 5 years in a row now!"
asics Very pleased
asics The length is perfect the toe box is a little snug but once broken in i expect will be fine and the laces are normal length and not extra long
asics Awesome shoes. Great if you are on your feet all day.
"asics As a runner I've always used ASICS, and when my son needed a solid shoe for everyday use I knew it had to be ASICS as well.  Being hard on shoes I knew they would get beat-up.  These have survived a beating, washings, and stinky feet. You can't go wrong with these, my son says they are extremely comfortable."
asics Read in past reviews shoe ran half size big. Not so much.
asics Very Nice.
asics 3rd  Pair.
"asics Awesome sneakers, I'm on my feet all day long, they are wonderful!"
asics Great shoe
asics very happy with this pair of shoes
asics Great shoe
asics Great fit!!
"asics 6'7"" 225 lbs and they have held up well!"
asics good shoes
"asics Only gave 4 stars because I haven't really broken them in but felt great right out of the box. Seems like all shoes are being cut smaller these days. I used to where a 13 , bought these in 15 so do with that what you want with that.  Seem solid,  great price."
"asics I had a previous pair. So fit was easy to get right. This will be my third pair, however I see that you have bettered the top of the toe section by adding a liner inside. That was the only problem I had with the shoes before as this area would wear through. Now I hope they will last longer."
"asics Excellent, lightweight shoe. Followed another reviewers's advice and orders the E width and couldn't be happier."
"asics Haven't put a lot of miles on them yet, but so far, I am very happy with these shoes.  I have bought three different models of ASICS running shoes in the past year.  The consistency of build quality, fit, comfort, sizing, and durability are just some of the reasons I keep coming buying ASICS.  I do wish I could find the snazzier colors (all three pairs of mine are primarily grey or white) in my 4E size and at my price, though!"
"asics I ordered it a half size bigger just to make sure and I am glad I did. these are pretty snug. I normally wear a ten, ordered a 10 1/2.<br/>Other than that very comfortable and nice looking shoe, I like them a lot."
asics Great price for a great shoe!
asics Nice shoe
asics They rock
asics very good
asics nice shoe
asics I love it
asics Good shoe
asics Awesome!!
asics good shoe
"asics These are quite comfortable and look good too.  They are not marshmallow soft (those usually wear out in a couple months), but make my 2.5 - 3 mile jogs enjoyable.  I think and hope the ACICS will last the rest of the year (got them in April)."
"asics I guess I have average feet with no known pronation issues or arch problems, just want to say Asics are consistent fit wise, I always<br/>get size 10.5 and never had a problem. Seems like some other brands vary depending on the particular shoe (especially Nike, never know what size I'd wind up with). And last, they hold up well and have never fallen apart or anything like that."
asics perfect fit.
asics Good Product
"asics Ok walking/running trail shoe, but has no grip when the pavement (or other hard surface) is wet."
"asics As advertised. Good quality, neutral, trail shoe with good fit and good longevity."
asics Awesome!!
"asics Even though I've had lots of running shoes, I've never been able to run much until getting these ASICS. My knees would always ache way too much even after ~30 seconds. Now it's just the tiredness that gets to me, and after a much longer period. I'm going to repurchase these when my current pair decides to give out, not that it's shown any hint of doing so in the few months I've (ab)used them."
asics Very comfortable and great support.  The 4E is perfect.
asics nice shoes
"asics I love the fit, the quality and comfort of these shoes.  This is my forth pair of Asics."
asics Gray shoe for the price
"asics Super comfortable! I've always been a Nike guy, but I'm sold on ASICS after these shoes."
asics Great for my knes
asics their great!
"asics The fit was good, but the left shoe was more uncomfortable than the right one.  Didn't want to return it, so ended up holding on."
asics Not like it advertized :(
asics Great choes
asics I use these shoes as my primary walking shoe they are the most comfy shoes for the money. I walk almost 7 miles a day and never get sore feet. Too bad they are not making these anymore.
asics My husband says these are absolutely the best fitting and most comfortable pair of shoes he has ever had. Highly recommended If your feet are sore or bruised from working on concrete - etc. all day.
asics Seemed like a good sneaker. I thought that I stepped on something and realized that part of the sole separated after 2 weeks of use. I emailed asics about the problem but they never got back to me. I tried gluing the sole together with Shoe Goo.  I'm hoping that it holds.
asics great deal
asics Asics always run small to me so I ordered a half size larger like I usually do and the fit was as expected. Comfortable shoe and for the money I think they're a good value.
"asics Within a week of receiving these shoes, and with only wearing them for one full day prior, I ran in and completed the Kansas City Warrior Dash. They're excellent trail shoes that require very little break-in time and surprisingly little cleaning after being covered in muck and mud. Their traction is so impressive that I only lost my footing and slipped once on a very slippery and muddy course, compared to the other three members of our team who all fell at least twice each. I'm very pleased with these shoes and would gladly recommend them or buy them again."
asics Excellent
"asics My only complaint is that the laces constantly come untied. The laces seem a bit too smooth and slip out of their knot. I'm back in fifth grade, having to double knot my laces and all."
"asics Extremely comfortable shoe, I'll stick with these as my #1 trail shoe no question. Best one I've put on my foot al far with arch support and the cushion on the heal and ball of your foot is amazing"
asics Awesome
asics Comfy and the price is right. Ran trails right out of the box.
asics great shoe!
asics Good value!
asics Asics is my go to brand for running shoes.  These are well made with good support and materials seem of good quality.  Good support and the tread is well designed.
asics They are wide enough.  Perfect fit!
"asics Every time I've asked to try a 14 4E shoe at a shoe store, they've only had newbalance. I've never really wanted to rock the boat, but after newbalance discontinued the last sub $100 running shoe that I thought looked aesthetically pleasing, I decided to give ASICS a try.<br/><br/>I'm quite happy with the fit. I get more arch support, and the quality is on par with the NB shoes in this price range. I'll continue to buy these as long as they're available."
"asics Very comfy, I'm ready to use them for trail walking!"
"asics I have worn ASICS exclusively since the 80's, but have always purchased the high end models. This was my first pair of the lowest price model. You get what you pay for I guess, because these do not do the ASICS name justice."
asics I was a newbalance guy. I saw these shoes and I liked how loud they look. I read the reviews and thought I'll give them a try. Very comfortable even the first day. I'd definitely buy Asics again.
asics 4E is my best fit. Hurray
"asics I liked it, but the sizing seems different with each company. I should have ordered size E instead of D. Fitting better now that I've worn them a couple of times. Overall l like the shoes."
asics Fits perfectly. Haven't worn them yet cause they are back up pair.
asics great
asics I love these shoes! These are the second pair I've bought. :)
asics great
asics Nice shoe.
asics good fit
asics Needed wearing only once to get them broke in
"asics Actually, my left foot would not give these  shoes a star.  I don't know if they were too small or too large.  I'm large, but the shoes hit my feet in places they weren't suppose to have contact with my feet.  I gave them three stars because they seem like a nice pair of shoes for someone else's feet."
asics Nice show for the price.
"asics I like my ASICS shoes. Used to wear them for distance running, but this pair is just for general outdoor stuff. Like the solid grip of the sole."
asics Good shoes for the gym.
asics Nice
asics nice
"asics Purchased for my son.  He loves the style, color and the fit"
asics good
asics good
asics good
asics Just ok
asics nice
"asics Purchased for my husband who needed a comfortable running shoe,  he loves them.  Very comfortable"
"asics Fits fine, Good shoe.One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen. Really Really?"
asics good product
"asics First pair of new running shoes that I've had in a while, my old one's were about 3-4 years old and were literally falling apart. I don't know how long these will last me, but so far so good. Excellent traction, which I really notice when traveling uphill or on any sort of incline. Very comfortable to wear all day."
asics Bought as a gift. She liked them.
asics nice shoes
"asics Great, comfortable shoe. I wear these daily and they hold up pretty well over time."
asics I wear an 8 and a 1/2 but I bought a 9 and they fit perfect. You need to allow for a bit of foot swelling if your going to use these for running.
asics My Hubby loves these. He had these before and we found them on Amazon.
"asics Great Shoe, perfect for long hours spent on your feet. I work in retail and I will spend hours standing at any given time, along with bending and kneeling and moving... few days in and these shoes and I'm debating buying a second pair for casual use instead of only having one for work. Great shoe that comes in the size that fits (No running small or large) and durable to boot. Definitely recommend a buy."
asics Great product
asics The only issue I have is that the color of the live product was not as I expected based on how it appeared on-line<br/>It has a lot more grey that I would have bargained for as it appeared much more black in color which is what I really desired to purchase<br/>I would have definitely not purchased if I knew that this was not more predominantly black
asics Only quirk is that the shoe laces did come undone while running. Double tying should stop that problem.
asics Sent them back!
asics Really like
asics Great shoe...nice support. Have only had them a couple days so somewhere around 10 miles of break in with them but they keep getting more comfortable as I use them. I will be getting a nice insert to replace the standard ones though as I would with all running shoes.
asics Good wearing shoes.
"asics With every new Asics I buy I find that the heel cushioning gets thinner and thinner and I usually have to add extra (thick style) insoles to them which is why I get a half size larger so my feet don't end up getting too tight. The grip is still good but the laces are still hard to pull through the holes when tying them. I use to like Nike air's but Asics are better for my heels and more affordable. I just wish they would make Hikers, steel toe work shoes, and winter boots! I also like these shoes because they still breathe but water takes longer to soak through so walking in light snow and rain isn't too bad!"
asics Fit very well...
asics I always loved asics shoes and these fit nice
asics Great value. Comfortable. I am on my feet 12+ hours per day. They feel great. One of the only running shoe I have found that my big toe hasn't punched a hole in the mesh on the top of the shoe.
asics Comfy
asics Loved it.
asics Great shoe for the money! I started walking more than ever for my new job and these shoes are the best. My feet hurt until I put these on.Very comfortable!
asics Great shoes
asics Great for walking!
asics Very good
"asics Running shoe that is also very good for walking. I've had them for a week, and walk/jog about 25 miles. I wanted to get the 4E width, but that was not available in my size. With the normal width shoe, after about 6 months the big toe or little toe area develop a hole. That's after 700 to 1000 miles. I suspect that is normal wear. These shoes provide excellent support and are comfortable for walking &amp; jogging."
asics I use insoles for the arch support.  These are durable and very comfortable.  They don't breathe as well as the higher end shoes but for casual wear they are fine.  The only thing I don't like is that the sole material is very hard which works great for soft surfaces like turf but on hard floors like tile they can be a little slick
"asics Should have gone with next size up. Other than the size, nice shoe for the price."
"asics Not for pointy toes, too much overlay makes them too warm, almost no breathability. Good quality though."
"asics I've been wearing Asics for years and I have to say, this is the most uncomfortable one I have ever worn.  I wear a 4E and it is way too narrow in the toe area, to the point that my toes felt restrained."
asics Good value
"asics My 3rd pair, I love them!"
asics The fit was pretty much as expected.  I would say it is just a little snug at first but not enough to warrant a larger size.  My experience has been that after they are worn several times and the laces are adjusted properly the fit is perfect.  If your foot is between half sizes definitely go for the next higher half if available.
"asics Love these Trail Runners. I bought one pair and liked them so much I bought two more. Of course, fit is very subjective but these are well made and the mesh is not as thin as other shoes. I particularly like them as it gets cooler/windier because they are a bit beefier and warmer than pure road shoes."
asics Great shoe fits as expected
asics nice shoes very comfortable
asics Good price and fit perfect good quality reasonable price.  Good selection  quick delivery
asics Really nice shoes for the price. Comfortable fit for lifting and elliptical use.
"asics I love them. The cushioning is amazing. I ordered the D/ and one 1/2 size up to 7.5. I am a chick with wide short feet. I will try a D/ in a men's 7 some day. Of course I would like more dramatic colors but hey, these suckers still look strong in grey. Happy feet."
asics Great shoes! Wore them to Disney World for 8 days with no problems.
"asics Nice looking, but the tread on the bottom edges started detatching within the first 45 days of wearing them - and that was only with casual wear not even doing any heavy duty running on or off trails.  If I could return them I would."
asics Fits awesome and sooooo comfy!!!
"asics I use the shoe to run in an indoor track about 3 times a week for the last few months. Overall, I have had no problem with his shoe or ""pieces"" of the sole falling off as in the other reviews I've read. I figured if you only use it for running, it will functions just fine. Comfort and support is standard, I wouldnt say it is better or worse than other running shoes."
asics Asics is my to go shoe. If you have a wide foot at least 4e is available.
asics Very nice
"asics I bought the same size I always do, but this particular shoe is smaller that others. Wrong size I should have bought 1 size bigger."
"asics The shoe is good and it looks great, but the problem is that the size of it is way bigger than venture 4's.<br/>I bought 12 size of venture 4 two years ago and it fit my leg very well. This one is bigger (longer) and I find it very uncomfortable to run with them (given that I run 5 Km. every day) so, my recommendation to all of you is to buy one size smaller than usual."
"asics Very nice, quite comfortable."
asics Perfect fit for my wide forefoot...
asics Works great on the trail.
asics Perfect
"asics like'em....comfortable, dont hurt my wide feet"
asics Most comfortable shoes I've ever owned
asics Usually prefer NB's but my last pair got lots of tiny holes in the mesh and the tread wore down like an eraser too quickly. These shoes are holding up excellent. The colors are really nice to. I've put a lot of use already into these and there are ZERO signs of wear. Even the tread is holding up very well in the front and backs.
asics Second pair of these for me. Though I dont run in them they are perfect for everyday wear seem to hold up pretty well to the abuse I put them through.
asics I like these sneakers
"asics Comfortable. They don't feel like an angel kissing my feet or anything, but they are good shoes for the support I think."
asics These shoes are great for a long day on your feet at Disneyland.  I bought them one size larger to help when my feet swell up at the end of the day.
"asics These are really good shoes, with good arch and support all the way around your feet.  However after 3 weeks of use the bottom orange part of the sole is peeling off already.  I would not buy these shoes as they are clearly defective."
asics My second pair of ASICS Gel-Ventures...albeit v. 5 this time instead of the v. 3's I have.  Great all-around shoe.  Comfortable and durable.
asics Great shoe with good support but fits a bit snug and a tad narrow in the toes. My foot measures at a 9 but I have to wear a 9.5 and a 10 would probably work as well. The loops for the laces allow them to tighten quickly and the tongue is wide and low so it doesn't rub my ankle.
asics Super Comfortable!
asics went hiking with them in costa rica- great show for it
asics excellent arch support
"asics Great support, attractive design."
asics love my Asics!
"asics This is my fourth pair of Asics Venture 5. I use them to workout in and they are perfect for the weight room, treadmill or the row even though they are considered a running shoe. I'm hard on athletic shoes and this shoe is extremely durable. Best of all is the low price for a premium athletic shoe."
"asics If you have trouble finding wide tennis shoes, these are for you. The 4E is very wide and that is what I have to have to fit my foot.<br/>I think that is is wider than the current model newbalance shoes. newbalance used to be very wide, but it seems that they have narrowed."
"asics Just a tad narrow, but overall, they're a 5."
asics Very comfortable and attractive shoe.  I use it for coaching (volleyball).  Looks good with shorts or slacks.
asics Match perfectly to the outfit I bought these for.  These shoes feel amazing as excepted.  They are asic's enough said.  Very fast shipping.
asics just wonderful for my hallux rigidus
asics Always loved ASICS shoes and this one does not disappoint.
asics First time I've tried this brand of shoe. They are very comfortable and the fit is good. As far as durable we shall see. I really like the colors too.
asics Great shoes so far.
asics Great quality and fit as expected. Feel super sturdy.
"asics Really great, comfortable shoes.  They fit perfect.  I use them at the gym, and I thoroughly enjoy the way they fit.  I usually go with Nike, but for whatever reason, I decided to change things up a bit.  I have a new pair of Nike Downshifter 6 shoes and, while I do like the Nikes, the Asics seem much more supportive."
"asics These running shoes replaced an old pair of ASICS running shoes that I have been using.  I could not even guess just how old these shoes were. I did know I wanted another pair of ASICS running shoes because I have tried on many other shoes, but ASICS is the only one that fit my feet the best."
"asics Shoe is very comfortable.  My 3rd or 4th pair now.  I only buy these now.  Have tried all other brands and these are best for me.  The shoes do run on the smaller side, so I always go up 1 size with no problem.  Only thing I don't like about this brand is they are squeaky when wet, but all shoes are like that and once they dry, they are very quiet."
asics Perfect cushion
"asics So far so good. Very comfortable, good traction. 10.5 D fit perfectly."
"asics Great price, better than store where I usually buy will buy from you again"
asics very good
asics Very nice.
asics Great shoes for hiking.  Fit is consistent over many years of wearing these.
"asics Love ASICS and this shoe is one of their best. I overpronate and when I put in my custom orthotic in this shoe, I go all day without pain and fatigue. Like it so much I immediately purchased another pair. I'm set for a while - and very pleased."
asics This is my first purchase of Asics. I always bought newbalance and since they have moved most of their production outside of the U.S. they just don't seem to fit right. I usually wear a 11 wide but in these shoes I took a 10.5 wide. These are so so comfortable. I go all day at work for 12 hours and my feet have not hurt a bit. I will be buying more Asics in the future.
asics These shoes are really comfortable and really durable normally shoes only last me for a few months but this brand I can wear all year before I need to get new ones. They allow me to move really quickly and they come in lots of colors and don't have some bright orange logo on them like other shoes. I will definitely continue to buy this brand.
"asics I usually buy men's shoes for the bigger toe box, and these do not disappoint. The heel fits snugly and there is no rubbing anywhere. I bought these as a duplicate pair, since it seems when I find a running shoe I really like, they go out of production by the time I need another pair. The cushioning is semi-firm and not too squishy like other gel-cushioned shoes."
"asics Super comfy, great for running. Will buy again."
"asics Excellent shoe, very comfortable. Wear all day."
asics quality shoes that last longer than most shoes.
asics Exactly what I expected very comfortable and I'll keep buying them like I have in the past
asics Excellent shoes
asics Love the shoes. They are comfortable and thy sure do serve their purpose...This brand was recommended by a provider at a clinic where I work and I can see why. GREAT SHOES!
"asics These are my second pair of Venture 5 Running Shoes.  The first pair were perfect but after time started to wear, so I decided to stay with the same ones, only these seem somewhat on the large size."
"asics Both my son and I have been wearing Asics, and the sole keeps pulling off on his shoes...with every pair!  We like the fit, but even with re-gluing the sole, they only last a few months on him."
asics I run on the treadmill after my workout a couple times a week at the gym. I decided it was time to get a new pair of running shoes and did a quick search for mens running shoes and came across the ASICS brand. I wasn't sure what to expect but these shoes offer the perfect blend of durability and style for an affordable price. I'll definitely be ordering different styles in the future and was pleasantly surprised with my purchase.
asics I like Asics products. These are really nice.
asics 2nd pair I have purchased!
"asics Awesome sneakers, I can't wait to wear them tomorrow!"
asics great shoes!!!
asics very happy
"asics I've bought 4 pairs of this model of shoe, as expected these are comfy and fit well. I still add a pair of insoles as I work on concrete for 14hours a day.  Love all the color choices."
asics bought these in the past and this pair seems a little tight. maybe need to break in more
asics Seem a little wimpy in material as compared to other ascics I have bought but they fit nice and feel good
asics Good rugged shoe.  Great for rainy days.
asics Love these!
asics Love this shoe. Been buying it for years now
asics Love it on my flat feet and they are very comfortable.
"asics Amazing! Most comfortable sneakers I've ever owned. Great at work where I'm on my feet for 12 hours straight and after 5 days at Disney World, I didn't get a single blister. I'd begun to think it wasn't a vacation there without at least 2 blisters.<br/><br/>Cannot recommend these sneakers more."
asics Always a great and comfortable shoe
asics My kids are both big fans of Asics - these are great as expected.  They hold up well and the colors are great for my son who is in High School.
asics Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect
"asics Very comfortable, as someone who suffers from plantar fasciitis these trail shoes came highly recommended by my doctor. Thanks for the tip Doc!!!"
asics I love them!!!
asics sometimes i wear one size and some time a half size up.  for these i needed a half size up.  With the half size up I like them a lot.
asics He's says they are comfortable
asics These fit as expected and seem to help quite a bit with the Plantar Fasciitis that I have been experiencing from using cheaper shoes. I would definitely recommend them.
"asics I am always looking for a great fitting, lightweight and BREATHABLE athletic shoe.  ASICS delivered on all counts here.<br/><br/>I wear a men's 10.5 and these fit perfect.<br/><br/>The Gel Venture not only fits the requirements above, but they are well made, durable and look really good.  I generally wear these working out at the gym, and some casual walking.  In 48 hours I will be heading to Taiwan and other than my Kung Fu shoes, these will be the only shoes I bring and wear for the 2 weeks as I am packing light for my exploration around the country.  I have no qualms about them doing their job and coming out on the other side fine and dandy.<br/><br/>5 stars."
asics Great shoes
"asics Comfy and decently strong. The patch thing at the top front of the shoe looks like it's sewn on, but it's actually just glued on and both are already coming off after a month of average wear. If they cut corners like that, what other corners did they cut?<br/>Overall, they're okay, but I won't be buying them again"
asics Great fit. Nice padding and pretty sturdy. Put these to the test the same day I got them and they were surprisingly comfortable even without being broken in yet. Will probably get another pair of these to have on hand when these wear out.
asics A great running shoe for a great price
asics Great shoes! Good value. Asics has always fit my feet the best of all runners. Consistent.
asics Good walking shoes  Love them
asics Very comfortable shoe.  Two way treads make walking and hiking easy. Uphill or down you get excellent grip and stability.
asics Bought them for my dad and he loves them.
"asics Well constructed, lite, comfortable and functional."
asics They are very comfortable
asics The best move I made look on Amazon. The info available for the correct size is great.<br/>The ASICS Gel Venture 5 Running Shoe is perfect for me. If you need a good walking<br/>or running shoe this model is one I highly recommend.<br/>I can put them on in the morning ware them all day and not notice I have shoes on<br/>and they look good...can't ask for more.
"asics Good shoes, walking for excersize at 400+ pounds is hard, these shoes hold up well!!"
asics great sneakers at a great price. i walk alot during my work day and it keeps my feet very comftorable
"asics I love these shoes. Some of the least expensive running shoes I've bought, and just as comfortable as the more expensive ones. Ran a pain free 5k in them a couple weeks ago. I put several miles on them weekly and also wear them when weightlifting several hours a week. Will definitely buy again."
asics Great comfy shoe
asics I have only used theses shoes a few times so I don't know how long they will kast but they are quite comfortable right out of the box. I put them on and went for a 3 mile walk with no issues. I picked this shoe because I had read reviews that they were good for larger runner/walkers.
"asics My 3 rd pair of these, They are so comfy. make good winter shoes as well. Love them so much."
"asics Great fit/comfort for the price. Mine are now falling apart after less than a year, but I run every day, so I got my money's worth."
"asics Haven't had these shoes for very long. So longevity remains to be seen. The first time I put them on I went for a 3 mile walk. After the first couple of minutes forgot they were new, and have been wearing them comfortably for my daily walking ever since. The price was good. The ability to get 4E is great for me and usually hard to find. They look good with jeans. So 5 stars."
asics Great fit nice color.
asics I have been buying asics since the 70's when I ran track. Comfortable.They may not be for everyone as each brand fits a bit different. They always fit just right so I am pretty happy with them. The durability of the parts of the shoe not staying glued seems to be more of an issue lately. Pieces of the shoe design come a bit loose sometimes on my asics. Haven't had these long enough to see how they hold up.
"asics Extremely comfortable. Got the 4E for the first time and man, I ve been missing out. Never liked wearing shoes but can wear this one all day, no problem. You might want to study the possibility of getting a 4E if you usually don't like wearing shoes. My runs are a lot smoother now and the side of my feet doesn't hurt like used to."
"asics These are my favorite trail shoe ever! Fits well, durable, and the colors aren't overbearing like so many styles that I have seen."
asics Asics never disappoint. Great looking shoe. Appearance of durability and comfort for the feet. I have to admit I cheat a little though. I go to a local store try on sizes in similar shoes of this brand then order on AMAZON. If then the shoe has a problem Amazon always make it right.
asics They lasted 14 months. Survived multiple backpacking trips. They were comfortable all the way until an inner frame started digging into my ankle. Good for its value!
asics Narrow toe box. Inadequate arch support for my feet. Sent them back.
"asics Great quality, I had to replace and old Asics that my cat scratched."
asics He loved them. Perfect fit.
"asics This is the third pair of this model shoe I have purchased.  It is a good walking shoe for all types of terrain and is durable.  I am particular about my shoes especially for stability of the ankles and knees, this model fits the bill."
"asics Shoe fit as expected, comfortable, nice design, all around a great product."
"asics Good shoes for the price you pay . Comfortable insoles . Decent running shoes . Not sure if they are good for outdoor running l? They do well on the running tracks though . There are definitely better saucony's for 15-20$ more , but the asics are slowly catching up with their shoes."
asics Ordered 1/2 larger because of my experience and fit great....
"asics These were 14 4E and could be a little wider. These will probably stretch enough to make them comfortable, but I just bought them and I won't know anything more until I wear them for a while."
"asics I buy these for my son, and he always loves them."
"asics This shoe met my expectations. It is an all-around good performer, and I am very pleased. Light enough, sturdy but not stiff, grippy but not too much, etc.  It does everything well enough.  This is not a performance shoe and I did not expect one. BTW, I am flat footed and have no problems."
"asics I've only had them a couple of weeks, but already enjoy wearing them, and they are very comfortable"
asics just doesn't feel like it fits the shape of my foot.  Can't get comfortable in it.
asics I use these shoes for my daily walk and they are the most COMFORTABLE shoes I own.
asics size is a bit smaller than I would have liked. need 1/2 size larger
"asics Everything about this shoe was spot on. I was hesitant to order shoes on line due to not knowing exactly how they would fit and feel but I already had a pair of Asics and felt pretty good about the gamble. Glad I did. They fir just right and look great. If these hold up like my last pair, I will have these for a long time."
"asics Great shoe at a good price, will buy more shoes here ."
asics My second pair they are really comfortable.
asics I work at a hospital.  My feet are tired and I use these shoes for running on treadmill for 45 minutes to a hour.  Very comfortable shoes.  My feet dont feel tired while running.  I have wide feet and these are wide as advertised.  Will buy again no doubt about it.
"asics I do a lot of trail hiking and these shoes a great, I can take them right out of the box and hit the trails and never get a blister, no ""breaking-in' required. I've been through all the brands over the years and have settle on ASICS. I won't buy anything else."
asics You have to love Asics
"asics My feet use to hurt after walking 20 minutes, now with ASICS shoes my feet can take up to 10,000 steps a day without foot pain; I have flat feet but the included shoe insert is fine but I like to add my own cushion to control sweat; I do like these running shoes for treadmill and light jogging."
asics Fits great! Very comfortable!
asics Awesome grip for Spartan runs. They handle all terrains.
"asics This is the third pair of these (or similar from ASICS) I've bought. I don't run anymore, but these are comfortable for walking and are durable enough to last at least a year of daily wear."
"asics size is not true to size....tooo small. Bought a 10-1/2 and caused hubby to get red rubbing and painful.....went to store and tried an 11--still too small, finally tried an 11-1/2 ---perfect (so a whole size larger needed) but NOW they are very comfortable, the gel is very cushy!"
"asics I love these shoes, they look great and have a solid quality.<br/>What I like most is the great support they have in general, especially in the heel, in addition they fit like a glove, making it comfortable to use both for running and walking.<br/>I would highly recommend them."
asics Have the shoes about 1 week now affects 90% of what I expected great runners
asics I have wide feet and am currently nursing a stress fracture. Not back to running yet but these things are amazing for $50. Very light and comfortable.
"asics I'll be returning these. The Instep area of the toe box was a bit tight, too tight to stretch out over time. The rest of the show felt pretty good. I am big guy comma 6 foot 2 comma 370 pounds and look for wide sneakers generally in a size 12 4E. The gel Sonomas were a great shoe I'll be trying the second versions next."
asics Good fit (15 4E). She has a stable base and seems sturdy. Only worn them a few times but so far so good.  I'll update my review later if I feel differently.
"asics I wear these to run on the trail, good shoes for the price."
asics My husband loves these for jogging.
asics Very good shoes
asics Too tight in the width
asics Great fit and durable.  Holds up well to the trails.
asics A little stiff in the beginning. Getting. Better every day
"asics I have been buying Asics running shoes for a long time and specifically the Gel Venture series since the Gel Venture 2. I run regularly on paved surfaces and treadmills.  These shoes fit me great and last a long time. I do, however, replace the insoles immediately before use with Dr. Scholls insoles. I find replacing the insoles every six months works well to help the shoes last longer."
asics Nice and light. A little snug for my 14M foot.
asics Good fit! Nice shoes
asics Great shoes
"asics These Asic 4e's are the only shoes I have found for running that don't hurt my feet.  They are very light weight and the souls wear out fast.  I tend to only get a couple of months out of them.  ( I do 25-30 miles a week.)  Wear issues aside, I love these shoes, and I will keep buying them."
asics These shoes are perfect. Last pair lasted for 700 miles of wear.
"asics I have wide feet and have in the past had issues finding a good fit.  For me these are the best fitting sneaker I have ever bought...which is why I have bought them 3 times over the past few years.  They do eventually wear out, but I wear them everyday so I would expect that.  Great value!"
"asics This is about the 5th pair of Acics I have bought.  The others fit well so I figured since it was advertised, why not.<br/>As soon as I put them on I knew I made the right decision.  Believe it or not, I still wear the others.<br/>This is good because I'm kinda togh on shoes."
"asics Great shoe!<br/>It's VERY comfortable and cushioned, but it can be VERY (I mean VERY) slippery on flat wet surfaces. As long as you don't run them on wet flat rocks you should be golden."
asics Great shoes! Fits well too :)
"asics Fortunately, I ordered these a half size larger (I'm an 8-1/2 medium bordering on wide). These give good support and break it fairly quickly. Though I'm not a runner any longer, I hike and use running shoes for my work (on location commercial photographer). I usually go through a pair of shoes in about 9-months, generally from standing on concrete, etc. I haven't had these long enough to try on a week's long shoot, but will write an addendum if needed. My other go-to shoes are newbalance 995 (also 9M), which seem a little wider and so a little more comfortable out of the box."
"asics Great shoes for trail running and even regular roads and tracks.  They fit perfect.  I do have a very narrow foot so if yours is wide I would get the wider size, and I normally wear a 9.5 but for Asics I wear a 10.  Love these shoes!!"
"asics Comfortable love the color. Not as cushy as Im used to, but they're comfortable."
asics These sneakers are very comfortable &amp; true to size. A great buy for the price.
"asics I wear a size 14 shoe and have low arches. Finding a size 14 that functions well is a challenge. I have nearly a dozen pairs of running shoes at home in the dead pile waiting to be donated after two weeks of wear.<br/><br/>Fortunately, these fit well, and feel good when I run. They also accommodate my orthotics with no issues.<br/><br/>Bought another pair before they disappear."
"asics Nice shoes, just a little tight.  Hopefully they will break in."
"asics A little heavy but, over-all, good shoe. Would buy again."
"asics Shoes arrived on-time and just in time.  I work on my feet daily and fresh, comfortable shoes are a must-have for both outside and inside work!  These shoes provide excellent comfort, stability and support for my feet in all conditions.  These are my third pair as Asics meet my needs for quality and dependability.  Very pleased with this purchase."
"asics Bought for my boyfriend, he loves them."
asics Fits as expected.
asics These shoes are amazing for the price. Just started running and I typically have chronic shin splints. I haven'd had any shin issues since I started. I will buy them again.
"asics The color guide is misleading.  It says Black/Onyx/Charcoal when the colors are Charcoal/Onyx/Black.  I wanted black shoes and got smoke colored shoes.<br/><br/>Other than the hazards of online shopping, these are the best shoes I've ever worn.  Been wearing them for years."
asics These shoes are amazing. My first pair of asics and they will not be my last pair. I put them on and could instantly tell the difference between these and my normal pair of shoe brands.
"asics The shoes fit very nice, however I walk 2-3 miles every morning and after about 2 weeks the left shoe has developed a ticking/clicking sound and the same left shoe makes my foot a little sore after about 1-1 1/2 miles into the walk. Kind of disappointed considering these shoes cost $50 and were supposedly designed for running!"
asics Shoe fits and is very comfortable
asics Best shoes I have ever owned
asics Fit is as expected but once again it's a pair of shoes with the shoe laces that don't stay tied unless you double knot them
"asics Good fitting shoes, but does not have the ""gel"" feel that I am accustomed to from others advertised as such. The shoes are comfortable, since they are new, so the real test of time is yet to come.  So glad I lucked up and was able to purchase them for $39, or this review might have a different tone."
"asics I have to say, these are some very comfortable sneakers. Another Amazon value to be had here for sure. Try to find a pair like this for this price in a brick and mortar store. 40 dollars or so very well spent. These are top quality. If Darth Vader wore sneakers, they would look like this."
asics Fits as expected comfie
"asics Fits good, priced right."
asics I tried to get eee width but these feel fine.  I haven't actually worn them yet but I tried them on with my orthotics and walked around and I saw no problems.
"asics Love these shoes!  I bought them for running on trails but I use them all the time now!  Much better than the newbalance I have for road running!  They are a tiny bit more narrow than normal, but that is fine with me as I like my shoes to be tight when running trails."
"asics Ordered 1/2 size up as recommended, but I think ordering actual size would have been just fine. 1/2 size larger feels a bit sloppy, have to lace 'em up tighter to compensate. Also, not as nice as the previous model Gel Venture 4 in my opinion. Not too bad though. Add them to watchlist and wait for the price in your size to drop. Got these for $39 plus 25% off. Sweet deal."
asics Love these a lot a lot because they are good ha ok lol
asics Smaller than other 13D by Asics.
"asics bought these for my son.  He likes them, he said they are very comfortable."
asics Everything about this shoe was fine except for the look of the toe area. They don't show it in the picture but the toe area is very boxy and larger than pictured. My wife said they looked like Frankenstein's shoes so I returned them. Other than the toe area they fit nicely and supported my arches.
asics Its not as good as I thought but ok.
asics Thank you. They are great. 100% new.
"asics My son, 15 yo, appears to like them and feel very comfortable in them"
asics :)
asics These are great shoes but they run small.
asics Too small
asics Love them
"asics after trying 4 different pairs of shoe all from different brands but all of them are made in china. Obviously cheap in quality, i finally like these, comfortable and enough cushion inside."
asics Great walking around shoe.
asics Hubby happy with the size and feel.
asics Best shoe ever for my husband!
"asics Ran three times and the shoes started to tear up my right heel and put weird pressure on the ball of my left foot so that after I ran I was sore the rest of the day in that spot, honestly they are terrible for me and I need to buy new shoes"
asics I lov them.
"asics Great shoe, priced right!"
asics I was hesitant at first to get E width but I found out these do run narrow. I think if you have a normal foot you should order the wider one and you'll be more satisfied. I like the way these fit much better. This is my second pair but a wider one and I like them better.
"asics Disappointed with this show. Probably the heaviest ""running"" shoe I've ever purchased, and would not have if I didn't get them online."
"asics Great shoes, can't even tell you got them on."
"asics Good fit, comfortable with a nice soft cushion sole"
asics a little narrow but well made
asics These shoes are comfortable from the get go and give excellent foot support. I had bought a pair similar to these from Amazon and they were wrong sized. Amazon took them back hassle free so I had no problem buying this pair later. I buy a lot of things from Amazon and am always satisfied.
"asics I love these shoes my feet don't hurt as much anymore, woohoo! I should of got them maybe as a 9 4E but I'll worry about that next time. They fit and my feet aren't hurting all the time anymore. Thank you! If anyone else is looking for that perfect shoe to actually fit your feet then tread no further this seller knows what he/she/they are doing."
asics Great running shoes!
"asics I purchased these shoes in July, now in September I can't wear them because the inside of the heel on both shoes has torn exposing a hard plastic piece that cuts into my heels. Loyal Asics customer for years. This is the only pair that has done me wrong."
asics Love these shoes
asics Very good shoe. Plan on buying another pair.
asics Love these shoes only brand I buy
"asics I am female, but feet fit better in men's athletic shoes.  Aside are my running shoe of choice. They give me the support I need. My feet are a bit flat. Too much arch is bothersome to me. These are perfect. I walk 4 miles per day. These shoes last about 4 months which is excellent."
asics I wear a 12 but got a 12.5 in case they run small which they do. Size 13 would have fit better. Other than that there is good cushion in the heal and a nice rubber sole. I'll end up buying a second pair in different color.
asics Great comfortable running shoes.
"asics This is my first time wearing Asics.  I normally wear newbalance and these fit very similar by size.  I have had bad luck getting Nikes and Adidas to fit as they seem to run small, but the Asics were right on.  I like the subtle look of these and was glad to find a pair that didn't have a neon colored sole to draw attention to my feet."
"asics So far, very happy. Came within a couple of days. They look great. Bought them for my boyfriend and I haven't given them to him yet so I'll update my review when he tells me what he thinks. üëç"
asics Good buy
asics Shoes fit very well! Ran two miles twice in first week and had no chafing or discomfort in new shoes even before break in period. They are still new so we will see how they last.
asics I had been running with asics GT-2000 for a couple years. I bought these because I needed black running shoes for a job. My job consists of lots of running (6-10 miles per shift) and these shoes really aren't ideal for concrete. My feet hurt after every shift in them.
asics Coming apart at the toe a little sooner than expected but great fitting shoes.
"asics Asics just fit my feet well. I moved from another brand that was giving me foot pain for some odd reason. No matter if I spend $50 or $100 on Asics, they feel great."
asics good
asics First time I've ever purchased shoes without trying them on. These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned period. Fit true to size.
asics Like the shoe.
asics Never felt so comfortable. I went for 7.5 and length is perfect. however I feel width if somewhat narrow.
asics Love these shoes! I've bought a few pair for my 12 year old son and they last until he outgrows them-not many shoe brands do!
"asics Great shoes, very comfortable!!"
asics I wear these for work and I work 12 hour rotating shifts on concrete. So far these are the only shoes I've found that my feet don't hurt by the end of the day. Comfortable and fairly stylish.
"asics I had no problem with the fit, but it seems these shoes haven't even lasted 300 miles before wearing out, feeling flat.  My run time has slightly decreased and my legs feel more fatigue from impact.  I normally wait til between 500 and 700 miles prior to replacing my shoes.  I run around 25 to 30 miles a week, and I've had these for about 10 weeks.  I'm a bit disappointed, since I've been buying ASIC's GEL venture shoes for a few years now and I've been extremely happy with them.  I had 4 pairs of the Venture 4 version, and those each lasted around 6 months.  I wonder if I just received a weaker pair, or if there's some variation between the Venture 4 and 5 that I'm not aware of, but I don't think I'll be ordering these again."
"asics Like many of the other reviewers, I would agree that this shoe runs slightly small, especially in the arch and length.  My personal recommendation is to consider purchasing as size 1/2 larger than normal. Otherwise, I like the shoe and the quality appears to be good."
asics Shoes look good but a size 9 is really a 81/2. I sent back the shoes.
asics They fit fairly well but a bit narrow for being listed as wide width.
asics Very comfortable.
asics Very comfortable and have helped with my shin splints.
asics As advertised
asics as advertised
asics Fits perfect.  Great shoes for big footed guys.
"asics I started running about 3 months ago and these feel great, the price is very afordable and im running a lot better than before"
"asics Great shoes, took a week to feel totally comfortable.  Now they fit like slippers."
asics Asics makes a great sneaker. I've had plenty. I'm 230 lbs and run a lot and they perform flawlessly. I do recommend wearing them around the house and walking so as to break them in.
asics good shoe
asics Honest seller. Great shoes at a good price. Fast shipping
"asics Not as described. I cannot feel the gel at all and the shoe is somewhat strangely formed. I have had some really good shoes from Asics so far, but probably one will need to spend at least 150 USD on them."
asics I will reorder once refund is posted.  I will just have order a larger size.  In my case this particular shoe runs about a full size smaller.
"asics These run small in the toe box. I'm a 12M and could not wear them. Returned. I'm an Asics fan though, their interior cushion is the best."
asics Have to be the best tennis shoes I have worn in a long time.
"asics I always buy Asics for running, but need to wear them around the house to help with sore heals.  Color is nice, but I might change out the red laces."
asics good fit. Wide enough for me.
"asics He loves his new shoes! Says they feel good and likes that they make him feel taller (the heel is about 1.5 inches thick).<br/><br/>I also got them in another color. Great shoes for the cost. A little stiff at first, but most new shoes are. Have to break them in."
"asics Really, too early to answer these questions...at first they felt like brand new shoes, of course; within an hour or two I forgot that I was wearing them, which seems to be a good thing.  I also increased the comfort level by carefully adjusting the string tensions.  So far so good."
asics Great
"asics I love my ASICS Gel Running Shoe.......even though most of my activity is walking, hiking, or biking.  Awesome shoe.  I also wear custom orthotics in the shoes and use a SPENCO pad on top of them.  I was a newbalance user for years until I tried ASICS.  Awesome!!!!"
"asics LOVE ASICS, especially being able to find wide shoes.  However, NOTE:  If you have flat feet, these are NOT the shoes for you.  Didn't realize that these were the exact opposite insole to support my feet that role inward.  Next time, I'll go to the ASICS site first to do some research."
asics Good fit and comfortable but sole of the show started detaching at the toe after my third run
"asics Very comfortable. As someone who likes greys and blacks, the color is great. Be warned that the grey is a little darker than the photo and the red is a little closer to crimson than the cherry red shown. It's not a deal breaker though. I really like these shoes for running and casual wear."
"asics It would have fit as expected if I had actually received it. A completely different shoe, received instead women's patent leather shoes."
"asics Incredibly comfortable, light and great for all of my uses."
asics Very comfortable &amp; ft is perfect. Love the blue/gray color.
asics Perfect fit
asics Good shoe on the snug side for 4E width
"asics The shoes have a nice support structure.  They were not quite as wide as I expected, but are pretty good overall."
"asics My Asics have always been a great fitting shoe, wore them the first day and have worn them everyday as my workout shoes and even on my remodeling of the master bath room.<br/><br/>This brand and type have been my go to shoe, and I own three pair."
asics I really wanted to like these.....they seem very well made. I just could not get used to the way they would rub on my arch.....couldn't stand wearing them for more than 5 minutes. Had to return them.
asics Great deal for an all around great running sneaker!
asics My oldest son really likes these shoes. They fit him well.
"asics can only wear with thin socks,,ordered next size up..."
"asics My son loves them..<br/>I bought it as sports shoes, replacing the regular ones that he keeps ripping during his sports activities. I hope these rugged ones will last longer.<br/>I will try to update the review in a few months, with how long these shoes lasted."
asics Bought these for my dad who is 74 years old and he loved them. He didnt take them off all day and felt very comfortable in them. He's a size 9 wide width. Bought size 9 4E for wide width and they fit perfect. Will definitely recommend these shoes.
asics Average
asics good product
"asics Similar (nearly identical) to another pair I had. More of a hiking sneaker than a running shoe. Stiff. Will take some time to break in. Last pair the souls wore out before the uppers, so it will likely be in my rotation for a while. Not my go-to shoe but a good change of pace."
asics Thank you!  I'm very content with them and they fit good.
"asics Nice light shoe, just a little tight."
"asics I like the look and construction of the shoe, but they were much smaller than other shoes in the same size. I also liked the feel of the sole. Sorry to have to return them."
"asics I have always wore Nike my whole life, but recently their shoes have gone down hill. After a few hours of use my feet were killing me. I searched for all day comfort shoes and found asics their nice but not great. They are slightly larger then expected I ordered 10's but they feel like a 10.5. I do like them and they are better then Nike but still hurt the ball of my feet after 4+ hours."
asics I wear these when I work in the kitchen. No slip on oil. Plus very comfortable on the 12 hour shifts
asics They are comfortable and fit as expected. They feel a bit heavy but not cumbersome. The cushioning is good and theyou feel well made.
asics I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas.  He has a really wide hard to fit foot.  Needless to say.  He is sooo happy.  He said they fit wonderfully.  They have great arch support.  Great fast delivery.  Nicely made shoe.  We will purchase this shoe again.
asics I've switched over to Asics for my daily wear. I'm a heavy individual with weird feet (15 narrow) and these give me the heel support that aleviates some of my planar fasciitis.  I spend much of my time working at my standing desk and switching between several pairs of Asics over the week means I always have a fresh pair with good support.
"asics I have owned nothing but ASICS shoes for about 10 years now, and after being a little disappointed with the last 2 different models of shoes made by ASICS I can say I really like these shoes! Overall a very good show with good heel support, but they could use a little more arch support."
"asics The shoes are much darker than what appears in the picture and I thought about returning them, but the comfort level makes them worth keeping.  Ever since I had problems with plantar fasciatis a few years ago Asics are the only shoes I will buy.  So other than the misleading color on the Amazon site, I am satisfied."
"asics This is a nice shoe for the price range. If you pick the right size then you don't have to worry. The fitting is pretty good. I primarily use for Gym, jogging, etc. and it feels pretty comfortable. I bought it for $40 dollars and for this price range it is surely worth it."
"asics Very happy with these shoes, which is why I keep buying them over and over again.  I'm a casual runner who likes the extra traction from the soles since I often use them on trails.  Can't say how they would hold-up for extreme distances since I am far from running a marathon but they suit my needs at an affordable price."
asics l like every thing about them.
asics They look and feel great. I've had good experience with ASICS in the past and was not disappointed.
asics my 2nd pair
"asics Great shoes for hiking and Jay walking. Especially Jay walking. All the cars slow down and yell out the window at me now. ""Damn Daniel!"""
"asics Great product, fit as it should.  I walk about 10 miles per day on concrete and these are the best shoes I've ever worn. Comfortable starting the first time I put them on.<br/><br/>The only issue was the length of time it took to get. It was 2 weeks from purchase to delivery. In today's world it should be much shorter."
"asics These are working great for me.  The heal loops on these were twice the size of the other pair I ordered in a different color, but not a problem so far."
asics They are fine. Comfortable enough. No complaints or problems. After several weeks of wearing them I find that I gravitate to them as my preferred shoe choice. Decent shoes.
asics So far I like the shoe. Ive had them for about a month and the only problem I've had is some of the rubber on the side of one of the shoes started peeling away. This only affects how the shoe looks.
asics I wear an 8D.  These fit very snug like a narrow.  Tight over instep an toe area.<br/>Previously had pair of Asics Gel Kayano 19's (8D) fit perfect and lasted almost 3 years with nearly daily wear.
"asics This shoe is awesome fits perfect. And as for running,the weight of this shoe is so light that it does not feel like you have any thing on. And the cushion feels like you are running on air. Awesome will buy it again. Would give it a 10 if it were possible.üèÉ"
asics Love the shoes. Feel like I have been wearing them for months.
"asics My Brooks had worn out, so decided to take a chance on these. I'm size 8 and the shoes fit very well. My feet don't slip inside and I don't have to lace them too tight. I use them primarily for hiking, and they have great traction. Really pleased with my purchase."
"asics I have plantar fasciitis and this is what my foot needed to help it heal. Easy to break in, and very comfortable, I did buy this shoe in a 1/2 size bigger, this isn't what I would run in being a Minimalist runner but very nice for walking on long walks. Nice job!! Would buy this shoe again."
"asics Love these shoes, much better than what I expected. I bought them for a 50k ultra trail race thinking they would be somewhat rigid and I was wrong, these shoes are really flexible and soft. Would really buy another pair. The lowlight is they could provide a better protection in the front of the shoe."
asics The shoes felt a size too small.  Comparing them to the previous size 14 ASIC's I own the length was noticeably shorter.  They also felt narrow at the top of the foot.  Had to return.
"asics I have lower back pain which creates a need for a shoe with good support and a nicely cushioned heel.  Nike Zoom Vomero 5 s have fulfilled this need in the past but the latest versions of Nike Zoom Vomero shoes are just not the same.  They have become very flat with little to no arch support and very little cushion in the sole or heel making them very uncomfortable.  FWIW, my wife has no back or knee pain and has the same complaints with how cheaply made and uncomfortable Nike running shoes have become.<br/><br/>The ASICS Gel Venture 5 Running Shoe could still use more cushion in the heel but when compared to the Nike shoes I returned?  They are wonderful!<br/><br/>After returning a couple of pairs of Nikes, I decided to try these ASICS running shoes and am very happy that I did.  I am a musician and stand long hours on my feet and unlike brightly colored shoes, the solid black color makes it possible for me to wear them even to formal gigs."
asics Way too small.
asics Aces what else
asics Excellent shoe
"asics Nice shoes, fit perfect"
"asics These are okay shoes. They don't quite have the arch support that I was hoping for. But they fit well, seem well built, and I like the style. I am afraid that the cross-trainer tread will wear out fairly quickly with all the walking I do on a daily basis. We will see."
"asics These are okay and fit as expected, but I like the newbalance MX608 just a tad better. Good value and decent cushioning, though I use Pinnacle orthotic inserts for better support."
"asics Hurt my feet after 2-4 hours of walking or standing. Not as comfortable for wide feet. Not as comfortable for a ""D"" width."
asics Decent shoe with good arch support for long hours on concrete floors.
asics Comfortable fit. Use them mainly for trail walking and on the exterior they've held up very well. The inside back of the heel did eventually get quite scuffed but not any more than other similar shoes I've worn.
asics Good quality.<br/>Recommendable.
"asics I bought these for my husband who has had a knee replaced and has trouble because of that and the fact he is flat footed. I was told that ASICS are good for flat footed people, I think they are right so far after a week!"
asics Another Asics excellent product. Perfect last for my foot and 4+ comfortable.
asics I got a 11.5 and they are tighter then my 11 Merrell. Length and width.
asics convenent  and on time delivery everything fit like it was suppose too I love using amazon for shopping without leaving the house
"asics My third time buying these and I can't say enough good about them. I am on my feet for 12-18 or more hours at a time in my line of work. These are the first shoes that I can honestly say keep my feet from throbbing at the end of the day. They last about 8-10 months at my workload on them, which is almost every day."
"asics They are quite nice, however the color wasn't what I was expecting. The blue was way brighter than it was represented in the picture, but they fit well, and they are also quite comfortable. Thank you for doing an awesome job!"
"asics I have owned many different styles of ASICS shoes over the last 20 years.  This is probably on the lower end of their line relative to the other styles I have owned.  That does not mean it is a bad shoe, just that it is not as good as some of their more expensive offers.  That said, if you are looking for a basic sneaker for everyday or walking use, this shoe is solid.  If you are going to be doing any kind of serious running, I would go with one of their more expensive styles because you will get more support/better sole construction.  I purchased this for my gym days where I lift or ride a stationary bike, and I am very happy with it for that purpose, hence the rating.  By the way, these are way better than anything Nike is selling at twice the price - Nike should be ashamed of their product from a value and foot health perspective."
"asics Long time loyal Asics wearer, their shoes never disappoint."
asics Have always  like asics they last feel great on my feet and look great what more could you ask.
asics Comfortable. Well made. Replace every few months as I walk five miles a day seven days a week. Seems to maintain arch support better than newbalance which I alternate daily use of
"asics Gel is great , light , fits perfect , looks great. Went perfect with my Ohio State outfit , color was a great look"
asics Correct fit
asics Very comfortable to run in....do not feel the road.
asics Comfy!
asics These are fine sneakers. For the money these are a good deal. I would buy these again. What else is there to say. :)
"asics I have a very short list of sneaker companies that I trust with quality for a good price.... ASICS IS ONE OF THOSE COMPANIES ...well made, as well as eye catching... I will be using these shoes on a daily basis, and you better BET they will hold up for the year that I'm going to put them to work."
asics Somewhat wider than description
"asics I use custom insoles so not sure about the arch support but I have wide, difficult to fit feet. These are the best out there for someone like me, who's width is further out toward my toes. They wear well and are a great value for the price. This is the 3rd pair of Gel Venture 5's that I have purchased."
asics These are great
asics They are Great! From a great Seller!
"asics Good walking, fitness and light running shoe.  Color, fit and quality were all as described.  For an everyday shoe they are fine.  If your a serious runner I would get their higher end shoes.  They are a lot more money, but worth it if your out there logging serious miles."
"asics Perfect and of excellent quality, besides an incredible good price"
asics So far so good! Nice and comfortable shoes.
"asics I love this product very much. Initially I ordered medium size 9.5, but it was little bit small for me. So I returned it. Returning was so easy and hassle free. I was impressed by the company and reordered new size 10. If the new one matches my expectations, I will write another review for this product."
"asics Typically most shoes no matter the price or style hurt my feet after a couple of hours. The Asics do great for a day but less comfortable the second day. I found the quality, style, color to be above average and would by the same shoe in a different color at the same price. Delivery time and packaging were acceptable."
"asics I love Asics shoes  This is my third pair.  They are comfortable, lightweight, and I think very stylish."
asics Great shoes for a great price!
"asics quality shoe, very lite weight"
"asics Comfortable, I where them every day."
"asics I bought these for my husband for Christmas since he loved his Venture 3's so much.  The Venture 5's are just as nice and high-quality, but they seem to run larger than the 3's.  I had to return them for a half-size smaller.  The earlier version lasted about 8 months of daily wear, which is pretty impressive for everything he has put them through."
asics Great price good product
asics Great fitting athletic shoe!  Good quality
asics I buy two colors diferents and I love this shoes.
asics Very pleased with fit and feel of this shoes.
asics Good job it feels really good
"asics For the price, the shoes are a great workout tool. It should primarily be used for running as the toe curve is very high. Lifting may be difficult as you will have a natural inclination to be on your toes. I am flat footed so it fit me well and didn't have the usual ache from getting use to an arch. I would buy again when these pair run out of mileage."
"asics .Excellent shoes, they fit like a glove. My feet are not easy to fit, 9 4E.  I have been buying newbalance shoes for more than 30 years , but their quality went down the drain. I like these shoes soon much that I just order another pair. Thank you ASICS."
asics Really like ASICS - often hard to find the style and size I need/like at local stores - the beauty of on-line shopping. Thankfully the sizing has remained consistent over the past many years!
"asics Bought these shoes for my husband. He wears through shoes very quickly but ASICS seem to hold up the best for him and he says they are more comfortable than other brands for jogging &amp; working out. Also, this style is modern and has a nice color scheme."
asics Great product!  As advertised.  Will order again.  Found these in a store for quite a bit more than on Amazon.
asics I love ASICS but these are definitely not my favorite pair
asics not as comfortable as some of the reviews I read.  Ran in them at the gym and they are ok...not great.
asics Looks great had to return for a smaller size.  Would recommend these to anyone for a comfortable shoe.
"asics my husband has bad feet and his poditrist recommeded Asics and thats all he wears now. they change styles every so often so when he finds one he can wear without his feet hurting, i buy them when i can . i just bought him 3 pairs. widewith is good, and his feet and back dont hurt when he wears them."
"asics Should have ordered full size larger.<br/>Very, very comfortable even with tight fit.<br/>Beware soles are very slippery in wet or damp conditions."
asics great shoes!
asics I love these shoes.  Turned out better than I thought they would.
asics I love Asics shoes and was very disappointed with these. For some reason they are very stiff. The arch is misaligned and I get massive pain in my feet when I wear them. I have never had arch pain and can wear pretty much any shoe except these. The sad thing is I wore them for a week or two then had to throw them away as I missed my return window. The Gel Venture 4's were great but the Venture 5's I believe may have some issues.
asics very comfy
"asics Great Shoe, My buy more!"
asics These are great gym shoes for me but not the best running shoes. I liked by ASICS GT2000s much better
"asics I have purchased these same shoes in the past and they were very comfortable.  The new pair that I received are not nearly as comfortable.  The inner soles feel ""lumpy"".  On one of the shoes, the arch seems to be in the wrong place.  It's too far back....too close to my heel.  And the other shoe has a lump where there shouldn't be a lump.  It's not real bad.  But still, new shoes should not have lumpy inner soles.  Otherwise, the length and width are fine.  Next time, I'll buy from a retail store so that I can try them on before I buy."
asics Best pair of shoes for the price. I have an issue with overpronation and don't even need inserts with these shoes. Buying more soon in other colors.
"asics The shoe has tight, and plastic feeling. Slippery in wet areas.<br/><br/>Not as comfortable in the walk as I expected. The sole material needed to have more give. More spring. Perhaps not fair to compare to my old Nike Air, which in its old age still has more spring than these new Asics."
asics Good shoes!
asics Good all around shoe.
"asics I have pretty wide feet and find it hard to find good running shoes that fit right. These shoes are awesome! I am in the army, so I run everyday. Not having big flashy markings on these shoes are a plus! Love the feel, love the design, love the shoe!"
asics Very comfortable and happy with product
asics Fit just like my other Asics at a great price.
asics Nice average running shoe.
asics Good value for the dollar.
asics Very comfortable - great support
asics EVERYTHING WAS GREAT
asics Not a great fit for me. The shoe didn't hold up well. Not my usual experience with Asics.
"asics Boyfriend loved everything about this shoe. Gave it to him for Christmas this past year. Fits well, loved the colors and best of all, he uses them all the time."
asics Comfortable but the soles already started pulling off after only a week of use.
"asics Very comfortable, moderately stylish, and the fit is spot on."
asics I'm on my feet for 12 to 13 hours in Heath care.  I've put down a lot of shoes that were a lot more expensive. I love Asics.<br/>These are not as comfortable as the ones that I bought about a year ago.  I would also  recommend buying a half-size up . Can't go wrong with Asics though
asics I love these shoes. It is very hard to find them that fit this good. Support is there on all sides.
"asics Fit well, and very comfortable."
asics I wear 15 4e and this brand is the only perfect fit I've found.
"asics Never knew how much a shoe could change your life. I've been told by numerous people (including my gf who is a physical therapist) to use Asics sneakers, and my whole life I had been using Nike's. I'll never buy another pair of Nike's again.I can't even wear the Nike's I have as my feet will start to hurt tremendously. New Asics user converted!"
"asics These seem really good, but fit a bit snug. I'd order 1 size larger next time."
asics These shoes are PERFECT for walking and hiking. Comfortable and roomy toe box.
asics Awesome shoes. Super quick delivery. Thanks.
"asics I wear them for walking, so never more than an hour and a half. Just took them on the first outing and they fit well. I have been looking for a substitute for Nikes and I think these Asics will do the trick. Nike shoes generally fit well, but lately they are using too much mesh that is unsupported by more sturdy materials.  I like the construction of this shoe."
asics Great
asics I buy a lot of ASICS shoes on-line.  I know to order them 1/2 SIZE LARGER than my Rockport or newbalance shoes.  This is necessary for me to get the shoe LENGTH I need.<br/><br/>The shoes work great in the field or on paved surfaces.  Very comfortable
asics I was able to try these on at JC Penny and checked Amazon and they were $15 cheaper!  These are great shoes but it helped to be able to try them on first.  These had free returns so the risk is low.  These shoes were recommended by several of my friends who run.
"asics Nice fit, very light and comfortable.  Ideal for my use which is cardio on the treadmill.  I like that small reinforcement ""patch"" at the point on the top of the front because I have had holes break through the big toe area on other shoes."
asics Being an RN and on my feet all night I figured I'd try out some Gel shoes. If you're expecting a nice soft step on gel these shoes fail to provide any of that. There isn't even a gel insole.  First time trying Asics.  Going back to my newbalance.
"asics Good shoe but it squeaks a lot. Almost rated a three because it does bug me. Maybe its a different kind of rubber i don't know. The last two pairs of Asics i bought didn't squeak at all, still really comfortable though that is what really matters."
asics My 11 years old son loves them
"asics The shue are comfortable ,bud the rubber sole at the front end start to came out<br/>I'm very disappointed the happens after 40 days and use only few time..."
"asics I bought these souly for running in the street, they are light and terribly comfy. The fit was also proper and perfect, I would recommend these running shoes."
"asics Great athletic shoe for the price, fit as expected, durable, very comfortable"
"asics Have been looking for a shoe to replace the Asics 2170. I bought 6 pair when I knew they were stopping production. Had to go to the GT2000-3 (or something close). Bought 4 of those. These will likely not be my main running shoe but I like the look and will use them as a casual shoe.<br/><br/>Asics, please bring back the 2170 and don't go too crazy on the colors."
asics Gift for my husband.  He loves them.
"asics Shoes are comfortable for working, however they are a bit narrow and therefore snug in the sides."
"asics Well built shoe, sturdy, fits well but the ""spring"" in the step is ""heavy"". the shoe lacks impact support and feels very heavy compared to most running shoes. I would rather use it as a cross trainer in the gym. It just doesn't have the ""bounce"" neede for running."
asics The shoes fit comfortably with the exception with the tip being a tad bit narrow but I got big toes and the arches are a tad bit shallow.  Other than that the shoes are great.  Even with those exceptions the shoes are comfortable and I can wear them for most of the day.  I do not regret buying them.
asics Thre shoe size  were  to small and narow. I have 2 other pairs that fit great. I ordered the same size that I wear . Maybe the mfg changed  where they make the shoes now  t Love ASCIS SHOES. Will go to a store to look for the shoe check out sizes
"asics I got these for my younger brother who was in desperate need of running shoes for cross country. He says that I really good and I am glad to hear that for the price I paid for them. Good buy. However, they don't look like some of Asics more expensive brands..."
asics These shoes are awesome! I run on the street and on a trail almost every day. I took them hiking in Big Bend National Park and they held up great. Solid running or trail shoes!
"asics Very happy with these shoes. I have tried a number of others and these fit the best, especially because I followed the other reviews and went up a half size."
asics I love ASICS shoes.  I think their half size are very accurate in fit.  They do take a few days to break in but after the break in period they fit like a glove. I think the arch support is good for about a year on this shoes depending on how often you wear them. I also like the color combination!
"asics One  of the most comfortable and supportive shoes I've ever owned, and I've owed a lot. Love the styling, well cushioned insole, and GEL technology that adds extra padding while running or walking. I would definitely buy another pair in the future."
asics They fit well and are very comfortable.  I have only wore them twice so i will revisit once i wear them in.
"asics Nice quality, well build. Would buy again. Fits a little too tight, but for workout that`s great."
"asics These sneakers had a terrible squeaking coming from the soles. I was able to get rid of it; by watching a few Youtube videos, I learned you can spray WD-40 under the inserts. That worked well to eliminate the embarrassing journey around the gym."
asics VERY CONFORTABLE  AGAIN 5STAR
"asics Fits perfectly, feels very comfortable, and looks great, especially with those cerulean blue laces.  :)"
"asics Somewhat small. I wear 10d-m. But, overall good running shoe. Nice quality and build."
asics Awesome shoe!!!!
"asics love asics shoes, fit great and the black ones look nice."
"asics these fit me perfectly.  they do have areas of mesh uppers but they still seemed kind of hot when I used them the first time.  maybe they'll get more breathable over time, but they are a great product and the price cant be beat.  was like walking/jogging on air."
asics I hate them.  I've been buying asics cumulus size 14 4e for 5 years.  They're perfect in every way.  Best shoe ever.  I wanted a trail runner so I tried the asics trail runner in size 14 4e.  It is unwearable.  Far to small.  Will be returning.
asics The only problem that I have with this shoe is that the inner lining has began to break down. Ive not had these shoes very long and this is a disappointment. And the problem lies in the fact that I bought 3 pairs.
asics comfortable shoe with good support
asics These are the most comfortable shoes that I've worn in years.  I'm a size 11 and sometimes have to go a half size up but the fit was accurate on these.  They are comfortable to wear for long hours and provide good heel and arch support.  I ordered the Indigo/Flash Yellow and they look great.
"asics I like the fit and the shoe overall works great. I bought some Adidas and tried those and didn't like them, to narrow at the toe."
asics Fits well. Great color to go with khaki &amp; black.
asics Stylish and very comfortable sneakers!  Love this style!
"asics I expected more cushion since these were rated the best beginner's running shoes, but they feel very stiff and hard.  However, running in them has been fine, now that I have gotten used to them.  For the price, I suppose it's quite reasonable."
"asics Great everyday shoe. Use them as a alternate running shoe (not as cushioned as my ASICS 2000) doing less than 10 miles a week in these. Lightweight and not as bulky for everyday wearing. ASICS have always fit me right so I am a bit biased, LOVE their shoes."
asics These are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. They come in my size (11.5) while others are either 11 or 12. The price is right and they are long wearing.
asics My husband loves these shoes we've only had them for a week but he says his feet feel WAY better. I was really happy to find good comfortable shoes in this price range.
"asics These shoes are the most comfortable that I've ever had. The arch support is very good. I don't wear these casually, these are my go to shoes for the gym everyday. I am a casual runner and these shoes were an upgrade from the Sauconys I had previously. Not to mention that they look good and stylish to boot."
asics So far these are my favorite shoes from aisics.
"asics Best outdoor running shoe I have ever bought. You can use them indoor too, been over a year and they're still going."
asics I usually buy cross trainers and wanted to try running shoes. I am an owner operated carpet cleaner so needless to say I put some hard miles on shoes. I gambled on these and they look and feel great all delivered to my door for under 50 bucks
asics These are the most comfortable running shoes I have owned. They fit exactly as expected. Very satisfied.
"asics Seems to be wide, not having too much luck with my favorite Asics this year, having a lot of difficulty getting something that fits as it did in past years and models."
asics I've always loved Asics and these walking shoes are great - a little heavier than I expected but have good arch support and are very comfortable - bottom line is I love these shoues
asics Bought these for my son.  He loves them.  They are stylish and comfortable.  I love the brand.  Bought a pair two years ago and they are still going strong. I go walking in them five days a week with no problems.  For the price I would recommend.
"asics The shoes work great, but don't breath at all."
asics I know these are a cheaper priced shoes but the back heal of the shoes has already worn thru. And I untie the every time I take them of. Just don't feel like me heal locks I. Well enough I guess.
asics A very good shoe for walking the forefoot could use a little more padding but other than that it's okay
asics They are somewhat narrow fitting so I'm going to exchange for wider or next size up
asics Great running shoe and good for walking too.
"asics So far so good. I ran 3 times and logged 20 miles on my new pair of Asics, very comfortable."
asics Shoe size is fine but there is too much arch.  I need to return to get different models that do not have so much arch support.
asics Ok
"asics Lightweight, great support, good traction, sharp looks.  Wearing them right now on vacation in Portugal. Got me to the highest point in the University of Coimbra: a coffeehouse."
asics makes trail running more comfortable over rocks and roots - still have to be careful on wet surfaces - otherwise these have made the last couple of weeks of running much more productive and fun.
"asics Second time we have purchased this style of shoe for my husband. I'm tempted to buy several more so that when he wears his current pair out we won't have to search for them again. Great product, great price, and they've stood up to my husbands wear and tear for about a year per pair which is amazing."
"asics Love them great support,the gel inside conforms to fit my foot. My leg and back to hurt when I wear my Ascis. I actually have 3 different pairs in a different style."
"asics great shoes. has good tread for off road and on road running. the wide version was nice and wide for my big feet, and not as narrow and uncomfortable as many running shoes. has a good spring to them, that really keeps your feet revitalized and comfortable"
asics Great and comfortable running shoes...! I have been wearing Asics running shoes for the past 20 years and I have always been very happy with my purchases.... I am using these running shoes as cross-trainers and they are very comfortable... I go to the gym 4/5 times a week and they are great...!!
asics My son loves these shoes -- he wears them every day to school. This is his second pair. They're very comfortable.
asics greats
"asics Great pair of running shoes, i wear size 11.5 to 12 and these were 12, perfect fit for my narrow feet...folks with wider base may have issues with these sneakers since they are built to be snug and hold you feet in place for running."
asics Very comfortable.
asics Great shoes for my walking and hiking needs.
asics These are great looking with dark and muted colored pants.  Asiscs always fit well. I buy pairs often because I put about 50 miles a week on them. I just enjoy that they look good with most things I wear.  Will replace in 3-4 months because of all the mileage on the tread and support construction.
asics The shoes have okay arch support but I still recommend a custom insert. I like the design of these ASICS over others because before there was never enough faux leather support near the pinky toe causing that area to wear and soon tare. These seem to be lasting longer. Good shoe.
asics I haven't used the shoes much. I read that they have a narrow fit and you have to order a half size over your normal size. The narrow fit is perfect for my foot. I'm very happy so far with the quality and comfort. The price can't be beat.
"asics The shoes fit wonderfully!!  My husband just loves them.  In fact, he ordered two more pair after trying out the first one.  He has discovered that for exercise, it's better to order a half size larger.  He's very pleased with the shoes!!"
asics So far they have been feeling pretty good at the gym. Looks sharp and gives me enough support when I am jogging.
asics I love this brand and this was the first time I bough shoes online. Sadly they are too wide for my feet and make it feel weird for me. They are super comfy and if I tighten the laces all the way they fit just fine with just a little bit of room but the complete the purpose that I bought them for so they are great.
"asics Great shoes, but ran a 1/2 size smaller than expected. I bought them for my sister-in-law for Christmas (she prefers men's), and they were smaller than her normal size. We had to return them. I'm still waiting on the refund, so my review of the third party company may change, if they do not follow through on the return soon."
asics great shoe.  Bought for Spartan races. I am happy
"asics They do what we expected, very well build and comfy"
"asics After wearing several Nike and Reebok sneakers, Asics is prety good quality and price + cool design!"
"asics Fits husband perfectly, size as expected."
"asics I bought these purely for running and so far they've been excellent. I'm not sure if it's just due to more muscle stamina from running, but I have not been nearly as sore after running when wearing these. As long as they continue to hold up, these are excellent shoes for the cost."
"asics I do feel like I definitely got my money's worth on these. They are Asics so they are a little wider than other brands, which is good for my wider feet. They are just as comfy as most of the other Asics I have had. They seem to be holding up fine after two months of moderate use."
asics Good all around
asics Great shoe and price!
asics Not consistent sizing
asics My old Asics are the same size and still fit. But these new ones were too snug in length and width.
asics Great basic lightweight hiking shoe at a great price.  For running I buy the higher end Asics since running puts more impact on the body.  For walking/hiking these are perfect.
"asics This is a great shoe for walking or jogging.  I have put more than 1200 miles on it in the past three months, mostly sidewalk or some trail walking."
asics Fit great but hurt my feet while I was breaking them in. They feel fine now. I really like them.
asics Good quality and fit
"asics They are shoes, and they are comfortable."
asics Asics are my favorite running shoe.  I used to run track in high school and college and this was always my go to shoe.  Great fit without any slipping or sliding. They wear very well.  I have never had any separation issues in the over 40 years of buying these shoes for running.  Always very well made.
asics I was having some discomfort (pain) under my foot. I tried different running shoes to see if the problem will go away without success. This one is different. The pain diminished. I find it more comfortable than the others I have tried.
asics I love the color and so far the durability of this shoe.  It fit perfectly and is comfortable.
"asics So far so good! Just got it less than a week. Love it for standing on concrete floor, hot weather and walking all the time...will let you know more if this shoe will last more than a month."
asics The fit was a little tight.  I'm hoping they stretch a little as I attempt to where them.  I dislike buying shoes on line
asics They fit well and seem to be made well. Too soon to say how they will hold up but I'm satisfied. Price seemed a bit high.
asics Good shoe for the price.... don't expect to use these for trail running but for 250-300 miles.  Should hold up that long.
"asics So much better than my last shoes, a little snug but good"
asics These shoes are all around pretty great
asics Me in my Adidas.
asics Great price for a good shoe.
"asics my cousin was happy with his running shoe! if he's happy, im happy.. it fit him perfect I most say"
asics Adidas !!!! Nothing else to say
asics my perfect shoe. just love them
asics My favorite all-purpose shoes (not just for indoor soccer).
"asics Bought these to replace the pair my son wore out - the pair that lasted longer than any shoes he's owned.  Being a boy and an athlete, he's pretty rough on shoes.  Plus they are classic cool."
asics Excellent shoes!!!
asics Shoes shipped quickly and were brand new.
asics nice
asics Cool shoes. Comfortable
"asics Fits awsome, i love these shoes highly recommended"
asics Husband was very happy with these.
asics Nice comfortable feel even on my first wear. Shoe size is just nice for my feet. The design is nice except for the tongue which is too large. I don't play soccer but wear it casually. A good comfortable shoe.
asics Great !
asics Confidently bought it as a gift for my nephew.  Fits perfect and looks great !!!  More than happy with my purchase.
asics Classic shoe that goes from the street to turf.  Fits well
"asics Sadly, I was completely disappointed once I wore these shoes. Owning Samba's prior, I was expecting that same great fit and experience, definitely not the case. After an hour of wearing them, I took the shoes off and could not bare it any longer. At first I thought it was a fine fit but that ended quickly. Two stars for because the shoes came quickly and in great packaging, but sadly I wont be purchasing these again unless in person at a shoe store. Bummer since I have loved Samba's FOREVER!"
"asics ESTE ES MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO,MUY BUENO, MUY BUENO..MUY BUENO,,MUY BUENO"
asics Classic shoe and fit as expected.... haven't noticed any compromise in materials compared to ones I've worn over the last 20 years!
asics The Classic. I always have to have a fresh pair of these.
asics Wore them as a kid and still wear them now... never had a bad pair! Plus they are so quiet... keep scaring my co-workers accidentally...
asics Year after year I buy these shoes for my son when he outgrows his old pair.  He has a slender foot and they fit him great and give him good support.
"asics Great value, delivered swiftly"
asics re-ordered larger size it as my mistake.
asics Very nice shoe...thanks.
asics Great shoes for on the go and well as lounging around. Comfortable and fit just right. Came fast and was package securely.
asics I've never been without a pair since 1980. Love 'em
asics He needed one half size bigger than he usually takes. Please keep that in mind when purchasing to avoid the exchange.
"asics I really like the ADIDAS brand, excellent quality and very comfortable, I recommend 100%, the delivery time is quick, others fit perfectly, I can say all this is thanks to you."
asics Narrow
asics GREAT
asics Molesta la parte del arco.
asics Great shoe
"asics Really comfortable after a few wears, looks slick and fits great"
"asics a classic, chic sneaker! so comfortable!"
asics Nice and comfy. Look and feel great
asics HUGE tongue. not much padding. breathe well.
"nike I have another pair of these Nike's in the exact same size (12D) and they are much wider. Beware sizing is narrow! These pinch my small toe on each shoe, other than that they are comfortable. I didn't notice the pinching when I tried them on and walked around the house on carpet. This issue didn't come up until after I had worn them out shopping and had been walking in them on a hard surface. Otherwise I would have returned them. I'm hoping to stretch them out by wearing them a few times with thick socks, if not I'll be out $55."
"nike My husband loves these, he wears a 4E and has never been able to find Nike's that are wide enough and the toe area is rounded so he's happy.<br/>This is his second pair, I waited to get another pair for him to switch shoes daily.  They take a beating and still look good."
"nike I'm very Familiar with the Nike Air Monarch line, been wearing them for over a decade. Needed an all black pair this time. Love the fit and comfort, although as a line they can be a bit squeaky. So far though this latest pair has not exhibited that annoyance."
"nike These replaced a pair of Nike Air Monarchs that I literally wore to death. As comfortable tenny grips go, these are the bom diggity! That's a GOOD thing! These are what I wear 99.9% of the time to be comfortable because they are SO comfortable. And my last pair lasted forever. I don't recall when I bought them but they served me well for a very long time. IE, great value. Of course I would recommend them and no question I would buy them again - just DID."
"nike last pair was listed as 6-13 (lasted a long time)this pair  9--27-16 made on date.both pairs have the same product number and fit the exact same way.Both pairs are prefect stable shoes, good for a treadmill.These shoes  make a squeeky noise first day out of the box, the same as 3 years back it does weird me out but goes away quickly  and worse case baby powder them once is all that is needed. bought em this week."
"nike These shoes were an interesting buy quite some time ago. I‚Äôve had them for about 3 years; but there is one thing I noticed a while into having them, the Squeaking. A few months into having the shoes they began squeaking and though I was a frequent walker back then, it didn‚Äôt bother me as much. I usually had headphones or other apparel covering my ears when I went out to walk. They were very comfortable for quite a lot of time; I did outgrow them nonetheless. I still have them to this day; and they are intact. I believed them to be good shoes; with minor issues.<br/><br/>If you don‚Äôt mind the squeaking and want the comfort more than anything;<br/><br/>Verdict: I recommend these."
"nike This shoe provides extremely good cushioning of the heel and sole and provides great support.  The vinyl/leather upper allows the shoe to hold snugly without the need for frequent re-tying.  For me, it holds its fit much better than a mesh upper.  As a result of the great fit, cushioning, and support, my plantar fasciitis symptoms began to disappear only a few days after I started wearing these shoes around the house all day.<br/><br/>The shoe really looks great too.  I bought the white version that has a large silvery Nike swoosh on each side and black accents in various locations.  It's a more adult look than the wild colors favored by teens.  I've had this shoe before, and I know from experience that it cleans up really well and retains a like-new look for a long time.<br/><br/>The only caution is that this shoe doesn't breathe like a shoe with a mesh upper, so they can make your feet hot if they stay on too long in a warm room.  But this is just part of the standard trade-off between a less-sturdy and quickly dirty mesh shoe compared to a less breathable solid upper.  For me, I wear this shoe almost all day, but I switch to a cooler mesh shoe for my work-outs at the gym.<br/><br/>By the way, the black version of this shoe is a comfortable thing to wear to work for places that permit casual attire."
"nike I've tried several different shoes, makers and styles. Nothing fits as well or feels as good as these shoes. My arches dropped years ago and these are the only shoes that give support, 15 years I've been wearing these shoes....love them!!"
nike fits true to size. Matches the size of all other Nike shoes that are owned.  It is about half a size smaller than most rebook brand shoes.<br/>Very comfortable. Used for all day and a little CC running.
"nike Have had trouble finding comfortable shoes since I had both my knees operated on. These nikes solved my back, foot and knee pain problems. Need to replace them at proper intervals and Amazon had reasonable prices and Prime shipping that took less than 48 hours for delivery! Wow!"
"nike The Monarch is for casual runners.  It is well constructed.  I bought this because I like the way they look.  I am re-starting my running program and decided the Monarch would work.  If you are in to distance running, a better (more expensive model) shoe is advisable; however, this shoe fits my niche.<br/><br/>Updated.... Just bought another ""replacement"" pair.  The originals were fairly worn out.  Did not do much running with them; however, performed a bit of cross training as well as casual wear with them.  Liked them enough to get the same pair again.  No change on original recommendation."
"nike The shoe is well made and it does fit as expected.  The problem I have with it is that it's a bit clunky and heavy.  I've run into this before with Nike, but with the ""Air"" in the name I thought it'd be okay.  Oh well......it's still a good shoe, just not great like you'd expect from a company like Nike."
nike A fantastic fit in a 4 E shoe with a more rounded toe which allows the toes to stay straight.  Nothing like some others which pinch the toes together to fit into a medium with toe cup.  My new go to rec. and home shoes for sure.
"nike These were a choice I made out of four brands, that were black and similar. I hadn't had a pair of Nike's in a while. So, I chose these. The arrival of the shipment got here ahead of schedule. The shoes I've learned to love. However, shame on amazon, for once again, I read false description. No leather uppers here. Like I said, I learned to love these Nike's. I was going to return them. However, not a conscious choice of mine. I learned that a synthetic upper for Nike, is in a class all by itself. These shoes work well for me. If there is any leather in the construction of this shoe, it certainly is not on the visible upper."
"nike Air Monarch's are the only tennis shoe I can wear because it has a really deep heel cup. I've never ordered shoes on line before, but I'm glad I did! These fit perfect and I've never seen this color pattern in Big 5 before."
nike I love the comfort level the shoes provide. I have a black pair from several years ago size 10 1/2 and I can't wear socks with them anymore too tight. When I purchased these I got a size 12 and they're fantastic like clouds for my feet love them.
nike I did not like the idea of buying shoes without trying them on first !!!!! But in my neighborhood almost all the stores do not have wide width shoes !!!! so I took the leap and WOW heaven !!!!! THANK YOU !!!!!! :)
"nike I have had the Nike Monarch shoes before and love them. However,  the last time I tried to buy some I was told that they were currently not available &amp; I ended up taking some other Nikes that I really don't like at all. When I saw that the Nike Monarchs were available again I promptly bought a pair on line. I have a wide foot &amp; the Nike Monarch 4E shoes are just what I need &amp; enjoy wearing."
nike Great pair of shoes and they fit my wide feet great. I have extra wide feet from years of wearing boots in the military so it's hard for me to find a good fitting shoe. These do the job well and fit as expected.
"nike I work as a nurse so I am on my feet ALL DAY constantly and these shoes are amazingly comfortable to work in. I originally had a pair of  Nike Air Monarch that I wore for over 4 years before replacing them with a pair of shoes that were more flashy and man was that a mistake. The 'flashy' shoes cramped my feet so bad and gave me corns...lol so I decided to go back to the shoes that I was familar with and reordered the newer updated verison of the Monarchs.<br/><br/>They are so comfortable it feels like I am walking on air, I love these shoes! The only complaint I have about these shoes are that they squeak horribly whenever it rains or snows and gets wet at the bottom....  everyone can hear me coming a  mile away and know it's me before they phyisically see me. This may be the only complaint I can think of, otherwise I would highly recommend this shoe if you want something comfortable and don't care about the bland style and can withstand the squeak because it will squeeeeeeeeeeak..<br/><br/>SELLER shipped very quickly as well!"
"nike Have purchased newbalance for YEARS because of thei extra wide EEEE shoes but not anymore....these fit like a glove and I never even tried them on, just ordered them and hoped for the best. Excellent in every aspect..... no more NB for me......ever....."
nike Purchased these for my dad for work. He loves them! This was his replacement pair. This is the newer style from which he had. He says the comfort is the same and that he is very happy. Will order again.
"nike Been wearing for 3 weeks and I am very happy with them.<br/>Have been wearing $130 shoes up to this to get good Arch support but these give almost as good at less than half the price, would buy again."
nike Glad to have found a place that has 4E Nike Shoes. These shoes are so comfy. I have a pair of the red/white ones that I wear all the time. Found this black pair that I can wear at work. So nice to be able to wear such great shoes at work. Don't go home with a back ache any more.
"nike I bought these to replace a pair of  Nike-Xccelerator-TR-Men-Running-Shoes that treads finally wore out and fell apart on.  These seem to be very similar.  I like the ""shoe horn"" loop saves mashing the heals"
"nike My new favorite Nike ! So glad I decided to get them , couldnt find my regular Nike's I usually get in my size. saw these and took a chance so glad I did . One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn."
"nike Slightly narrow around the front and middle section of my foot, but not so much I can't wear them. The first time I wore them they felt tight but the next time was less noticeable, and now they seem okay overall. Ironically, the heel area feels a tad loose, so that part of my foot moves up and down a lot when I walk. It's not like the shoe falls off or anything, though it sort of feels like I could ""walk out"" of them whenever I take a step (I never have). I like the look and comfort is fine now. Slightly better grip between the back of foot/heel and shoe would be better, but not a major issue."
"nike Due to diabetic neuropathy in my feet I usually buy shoes that are one size too large and 4e width. These are the only training shoe I have found in 4e width.<br/>  I've 4 pair of these over the last few years and find them to be of high quality, but they do tend to slip on the ice a little in the cold weather. If not for this I would have given 5 stars"
"nike I have been buying new balence for the past 3 years, I decided to make the switch to these Nike monarch and I couldn't be more happy.<br/>First off I have wide flat feet, newbalance seemed to be one of the only brands to give the wide option on almost all of their shoes. They are great, but these Nikes feel much better made, they are very light weight and the arch support is extremely good. For being a 6 foot tall 270 lb guy I go through shoes quite fast. I will update this review if anything goes wrong with these shoes. These are comfortable and awsome"
nike I finally was able to get this shoe in a size 4E. The extra wide size is perfect for my feet. The fit is comfortable. And the air in the soles gives a nice cushion for running and/or walking.
"nike ...bought these to replace 2 pairs of Skechers that each only lasted 6 months before starting to come apart...these are<br/>comfortable, fit is great, and I'm hoping to get at least a year out of them before buying another pair..."
nike Was happy to find these here. Go through a pair often as they are my main shoe I wear 10 hours a day at work. Very comfortable. AlsO wear them in white at home but need black for work.
"nike I don't usually order on line for my husband because he is hard to please.  He was happy with this shoe and they fit good, thanks this will save me a lot of time going from store to store."
nike I tried over and over to send these shoes back because they  were to small. I was ignored  ... so I was stuck with a pair if shoes I can only wear when I want look like I just got a new pair of shoes. Believe me I can't wait to get home to take them off. Thanks for nothing.
nike Have bought this shoe for years for work. I walk a lot and unlike many other style sneakers it never changes. Can stand all day on asphalt and cement with tired legs but no pain !
nike I love these shoes!  I live in a rural area and they are hard to find.  I was thrilled when I was told to check out AMAZON.  The price was reasonable and the shoes fit exactly as they should.  I have a wide foot and it is difficult to find my width in the local stores.  I will be purchasing more from this site in the future.
"nike This is my 2nd pair of these shoes. Had the 1st pair for 6 months before the reknowned squeaking began. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the squeaking to stop even after applying baby powder to the insole as some previous reviewers had indicated helped them.<br/><br/>Bought them again because the fit is perfect for my extra wide feet. That being said, I also purchased some Dr. Scholl's insoles which I am hoping will help alleviate any potential for future squeaking - or at least get me more than six months of usage this time around."
"nike I have somewhat narrow feet with an arch. These are very, very comfortable standing or walking. The tongue is thick with padding. When I tie them my feet are totally wrapped in a tight, padded cocoon. I have an unopened pair in the closet just in case they discontinue them."
"nike The shoe felt good and wore good‚Ä¶ for about 2 months.  Now, the sole is releasing and falling apart.  Sadly, I now have to buy another shoe.  I would not recommend this shoe at all if you need a good dependable shoe."
"nike My husband is a standard size 11 with med width . He has 2 previous pairs of these shoes. Since they have worked so well in the past we reordered as he started a xmas job at the post office- Totally disappointed. Toe box is too tight, squeezed the top of toes. Didn't even keep them they were so obviously not going to work. May have to go to 11.5 HOWEVER , never have had to do this before and am not confident this is a solution. Seems this pair is off or the manufacturing has changed ???"
nike They are a little tight but I am sure they will stretch as I use them. They are replacing a pair that is about 3 years old and I expect they were tight in the beginning of use
nike Bought for husband and they fit very well. He has a tall arch and it's hard to find shoes that fit. These are very well made and look great after many months of hiking and walks.
"nike I just spent a week at a conference wearing these shoes... they passed the test. I must've averaged 20,000 steps per day and my feet survived.<br/><br/>Oh, they also look sharp!"
"nike Best pair of tennis shoes I've ever had! Perfect fit, and very comfortable! This was actually the second pair I've bought. The older one I use for mowing, painting, and doing things in dirty places, and the other one for sports. Two of my friends have the same pair (different sizes) and are also very pleased with these. Totally recommend them!<br/><br/>P.S. The first pair I bought about 2 years ago, and they're still in pretty good condition, just dirty."
"nike At first, this shoe fit well, although was wider than expected. However, the heel material on one of the shoes got compacted after less than two months, which caused my foot to move too far forward and my toes rubbed constantly. I had to throw them away."
"nike These shoes fit too tightly, were heavy, and too hard.  There were generally uncomfortable for me so I returned them.  Amazon, however, had an excellent return policy."
nike My brother love this nike.
nike Fantastic shoes. Usually My husband has problem getting the right fit shoes and this one really satisfied him. We already recommended to friends. Arrived on time.
nike Fit was smaller than my last pair. I had to return them for full refund. Slightly disappointed with Nike. Quality is not as consistent as it once was. Probably my last pair of Nike.
"nike This is about my 5th pair, I have them in different colors also, my family call me the Imelda Marcos of gym shoes because I have about 30 pairs, if I don't like them I give them away to my brothers and best friend all the same size as me. But keep my Nike Airs"
nike Great fit. Very comfortable.
"nike For the second time in the last year I have had UPS deliver a package to the wrong address.  In both cases the items were properly addressed and labelled. but for reasons known only to the driver, the deliveries were made to houses down the street.  In the first case the house was obviouly vacant but under renovation.  The only reason I actually got the item was that I saw a box looking like the one I was expecting, fortunately a little outside the ordinary, and went up to check the label just as one of the workman came out and spotted the delivery.  I was able to claim the item based on my name and address, and while I would like to think that the individual would have gotten it to me anyway, who knows.  With this latest item, I was fortunate that the delivery went to a friends house across the street and down the block.  As soon as she saw my name and address she gave me a call and I was able to go over and pick it up. I don't know what is going on with UPS, but it makes me very vigilant if they are supposed to be delivering anything to me and I will not ship with them at this time."
nike I've had about 6 pairs of these and they always fit and are very comfortable<br/>I walk from 3 to 5 miles a day at work and am on my feet about 8 of the 10 hours<br/>They have not let me down yet
"nike I have tried once after I get it. It feels comfortable and sporty. However I have not tried outside. I may update this comment after hiking, or jugging or running atleast once."
nike My husband loves these for delivering mail. They are not the most fashionable choice for footwear but then you need support and comfort you have to make sacrifices. This is the 2nd pair I have ordered in 2 months because he loves them so much he wanted a backup for rainy weather.
"nike I adore these shoes, it so hard to find wide shoes that aren't ugly, and the price is amazing for name brand shoes. A must have for all adults with wide feet."
"nike Great shoes, months later they have held up and still look and feel great. Nikes are Nikes. Grab two pairs if you can, your feet and your wallet will not regret it."
nike My husband has been wearing these particular shoes for years. They are hard to find and I was so glad to find them on Amazon. He loves the way they fit.
nike My husband loves these shoes! His only complaint was how narrow the toe box is. I ordered him a second pair in extra wide width and he loves those even more.
nike It is hard to have a 2e foot width to be comfortable in affordable shoes. I am glad to run into any wide width shoe because it feels so much better.
"nike So far so good. Comfortable. Hope they last / So after a few weeks of wearing these shoes, yes I should have went up a 1/2 size, now they squeak to no end. They squeak every step I take and no matter on what type of flooring. You can hear me coming a mile away. Very Very displeased with that. I wonder if its only my shoes?"
"nike My husband loves them. This is his 4th pair. Since he is a diabetic, being able to get them wide is a must to protect his feet and toes. Will keep on buying."
"nike Bought them for running because they were listed as running shoes. Definitely not for running. I bought a pair of downshifters for running (which are awesome btw). At first I was concerned because they look like 'dad shoes' to me. But I where them to work on casual days and to walk around in when I know I'm going to do a lot of walking. Very comfortable and they have some style, had a few compliments from people who pay attention to things like that, so I'm happy with the purchase."
"nike I have worn Nike shoes for years and I have never been disappointed.  These were as described.  They are very comfortable and required very little ""break in."""
nike I like the shoe and have had this same shoe before.  I ordered the exact same shoe by the number on the tongue but for some reason it was not quite the right size.  It was about 1/4 inch smaller in the toe width.  I had to return them because they were just too tight.
nike Love these shoes. I have a pair that is wore out but they feel so good i use them as outside working around the farm shoes ... I can not get rid of them ... lol
nike They're very comfortable on my feet I had these sneakers before and I love the so much I wore them out so I had to purchase another pair
"nike Shoes were ordered, as the same brand, same style, and size. However these seem to be smaller in the toe area and are tight in that region."
"nike I wear size 8 shoe -orderd size 8 -normal width  .I m 5'7"" -130 lbs . They fit perfect . Little snug at first as are all new shoes . Hope this helps with concerning ordering a size larger issue ."
nike My son has worn nothing but these shoes (in different sizes as he's grown) for the last couple of years. Sturdy and comfortable.
"nike Great shoe, second pair ordered in a year. Hold-up well, comfortable. I wear size 13, and am 270 lbs. They provide good support."
nike I had to get these since my foot is so wide. Fit great and feel awesome. Would really like it if Nike offered some more widths in other styles.
"nike Grandson said ""Oh, Wow"" when he saw them and ""They're so comfortable ""when he wore them. His school uniform code requires all black shoes so he used a Sharpie to color the white letters on the shoe tongue. Perfect shoe for an active eighth grader."
"nike I started buying Nike Monarchs many years ago. Now I buy no other athletic shoe (except for running). A great shoe for everyday casual use and long walks. I use my old pairs for yard work, working on the car, etc. I have a hard time throwing them out. They are pretty durable. Great Casual Styling for us Middle Aged Men. This was my 11th pair I think. I usually have both Black/White &amp; White (with Blue Nike Emblem) styles. They have 3 different styles but I never did like a Total Black Shoe. But if you do they have them. Highly recommended."
"nike I am a nurse working in a hospital so I'm on my feet all day. I am tall and medium build and have wide feet. These shoes are comfortable, I just wish I could get them a little wider than the 4e. I wear a size thirteen and ordered the 4e, they cramp my pinky toe just a little bit but it's better than the other brands I have tried so far. If I could get them a bit wider I would give it 5 stars."
nike i've worn this model and brand for years.  Always high quality and perfect fit every time including this time.  Perfect!
"nike A bit hard on my feet ,on my  first outing in them. I love the look and style even though they are mens , they are what I wanted."
"nike I have been wearing Nike Air Monarch for years.  I walk 800 miles a year and I go through a couple of these excellent shoes each year. I keep them in stock at home. When I find them on sale I usually buy a couple at a time. Best bank for the buck, for sure."
"nike My dad has worn these for years and years. After trying on his old beat up pair, I decided to get myself some. His latest pair are two years old, so they are beat up on the outside, but still as comfortable as my new ones. I thought the 10.5 4e might be a bit to wide for me, but they fit great. A little extra room is better than them being too tight(like most nikes). These might be my new everyday shoes. I'll update my review after I break them in a bit. Won't take long as I walk 5-10 miles a day."
"nike Very comfortable.  I generally have to wear an orthodox in my shoes, except for these.  I just love these shoes. They hold up very well."
"nike I finally found the right size. But these are listed as a running shoe, and it was ""heavy"" like a walking shoe. I'm used to the<br/>lighter weight of a running shoe. These were returned and I then found another running shoe on Amazon which is a keeper.<br/><br/>4 star rating is based on the shoe wearing like a walking weight shoe which I have worn before."
"nike The company providing the shoes was great.  However, I've been buying the air monarchs for many years because they have always been the most cushioned, comfortable shoe I ever wore.  That is no longer the case.  The insole is no different from any other now, so the shoes are not worth the money paid."
"nike These shoes are very comfortable. I wear them nine hours a day on concrete working as an automotive technician. It's only been three days since I've been wearing them, but they have far exceed my expectations. They are awesome. Very light and fit as expected. I wear an 11 in other Nike shoes so I orederd a pair of 11 in these and they fit perfect. No more sore feet and legs every day from the boots I've been wearing prior. I would highly recommend these shoes for anyone in need of shoes for work especially if working on cement."
"nike #3 was the charm for me. I had tried two different brands before I finally found these Nike that fit me to a T.  I have had issues with shoes for the last few years and it's getting on my nerves. It shouldn't be this hard to find something I like, but it has become that. I get mens' shoes because I have wide and flat feet. Most womens' shoes are very uncomfortable, they feel like a vice on my feet. And I'm not going to put up with that. I don't know what's wrong with designers &amp; clothiers these days, but they are sure making crap. Those of us who can't afford a new wardrobe every season need to revolt. Clothing should fit the person, not the person fit the clothes. I'm not ashamed of my size. And I don't know why EVERYONE is trying to make me feel bad. I will go to Nike from now on."
nike Needed extra support after total knee replacement these sneakers were perfect.  Great comfort and cushion.  Have purchased in several colors since the fit is so awesome.
nike These are the best all around shoe there is! I cannot even guess how many pairs I have purchased over the years
nike A really good running shoe.  Very stable. At first I thought it was a little heavy but I have gotten used to it. I recommend them for runners with wide feet.
"nike Comfortable, good sole and inner sole.  Have worn this make for several years -- hope they keep making them."
"nike I walk a lot for my job and I got a pair of these about 2 years ago and they were great! About 2 weeks ago, the padding started to fail, so I went to buy another pair but I could not find them, they were out of stock.. so I tried 2 other pair of shoes and ended up returning both pair and I got very lucky because I ended up finding a place on Amazon that had the Nike's in stock and I got another pair. Great shoe, and they fit great!"
nike This is the 2nd pair of this shoe I have and I really like the fit and feel. The first pair lasted me for years.
"nike Great tennis shoes, I've ordered these before and they hold up well. Way better than newbalance shoes"
nike I bought these for my father. He loved them! The price was decent and affordable for the quality as well.
nike Look good and feel right. Not a runner but a walker and are great for that. Good support.I like them.
nike Awesome!
"nike Great sneakers that are loved so much, it's a repeat buy with this being the 3rd pair! He loves them."
"nike I don't usually buy clothes nor shoes online because I'm always afraid they won't fit correctly since I'm not in the States and the measurements are different, but after I made some research I decided to do the leap of faith and I'm glad I did. The quality of the materials is top notch and the shoes fit like a glove"
"nike I HAVE BEEN WAITING AWHILE FOR AMAZON TO GET THESE SHOES. THEY SEEM TO BE THE ONLY SHOES THAT FIT MY FEET RIGHT. AS A MATTER OF FACT THE ONLY SHOE BESIDES BOOTS THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN AT LEAST 5 YEARS. I WISH I WOULD'VE GOT 2 BUT WAS WORRIED BOUT SIZE. NOW AMAZON IS OUT AND I HAVE TO PAY MORE AND SHIPPING FOR ANOTHER PAIR BUT THE 10 EXTRA DOLLARS ISN'T MUCH CONSIDERING I'LL HAVE THE RIGHT SHOES FOR MY FEET FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THESE ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND BUILT TO LAST. THEY LOOK GREAT, FEEL GREAT AND I'M KICKING MYSELF WE KNOW WHERE FOR NOT GETTING 2 PAIRS RIGHT AWAY. ANYWAY, THANK YOU AMAZON FOR FINALLY HAVING THESE. I WILL KEEP CHECKING AND REST ASSURED I WILL BE BUYING MORE WHEN AMAZON HAS THEM."
"nike dont get me wrong, the material is great, and the design is good, but i didnt like it because in addition that it feels somewhat large, it is buffy, meaning that it gives extra size to its look<br/>i became reluctant of buying Nike unless trying them out in a store and see how it would look like. running with this cause scratches to my legs cause i run narrow. it is good to wear it when not needed to do anykind of exercise"
nike This is about the 4th time that I have purchased these shoes.  The other purchases were done from Penneys.  They no longer appear to carry my size (square feet) in stock.
"nike I've had two different pairs of Nike Air and this is my third.  There is a slight difference in the quality of the leather, perhaps because each pair was made in a different factory, from Indonesia, Vietnam, and China.  This latest pair is from China and with many other products from China the quality does have telltales.  Other than that its too soon to tell about its performance and its durability &amp; longevity."
"nike I love mine ,  the fit was right just what i had ordered .  I sometimes have trouble finding shoes to fit right.  Either i have to get shoes to big to get them wide enough or suffer from wearing a shoe that is to tight.  That is not a problem wi these at all.  As for the wide width or should i refer to the idea of people who need a wide width shoe,  the Nike Air Monarch IV (4E) are highly recomended in my book."
"nike I needed a solid black tennis shoe and this fits the bill. Comfortable, nice looking shoes."
"nike Good shoes, so hard to find good brands of shoes in extra wide. These seem to be built very well."
nike I have been wearing Air Monarch for years but like the black and white look of this shoe.
"nike I bought these for my husband, and although I knew they were the same ones he's bought before from our local mall, I was nervous they wouldn't fit right, and would possibly be too wide.  However, we both have been pleasantly surprised as they fit perfectly and were priced better than going to the mall for them, not even taking into account the aggravation of driving there &amp; fighting for a parking spot, and dealing with the mall crowd! Thank you!!"
nike Size was as expected - perfect fit.  Quality was very good so this is a product I would highly recommend.
nike Great pair of shoes. Very comfortable and they look good too. Very heavy and a big shoe though.
"nike Heavy, with annoying seams along the toe box. Returned after wearing for an hour. Ouch.,"
"nike Pretty great shoe, but material isnt superb, for 60 bucks its ok, worth more like 40-50 though."
nike Got theses Nikes for my husband and he liked them! They were better for his feet when we stands allot and walks.
nike i was pleasantly suprises by the comfort and the fit of the shoe. I wear a Castro ankle brace and the 4e shoe fit over the brace. I wore the shoe during Scout summer camp. It was comfortable and held up very well.
"nike I've been buying these shoes for years. I love them, wife hates them.<br/>I have to say these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned with one caveat, they squeak. I have learned the trick, here actually of silencing them with baby powder on the insoles but squeaks do arise here and there from time to time.<br/><br/>Are they comforatable? VERY Are they annoying? VERY<br/><br/>I've learned to adapt my lifestyle to the needs of my shoe *Snicker*."
"nike the 4e wide pair fit great. the regular d width was too narrow. 4e is quite wide, and comfortabe. arch support kinda sucks, but i use custom made orthotics so that doesnt affect me, and yes the insoles do come out with very little effort as they are slightly glued down."
nike This is my second Monarch pair. Very comfortable shoes. Ordering another pair soon.
nike Husband loves these sneakers. He is on his feet a lot and they are very comfortable
"nike Good shoes that fit as expected. My only complaint was the soles squeaking when walking. I thought that it would go away with time, but sadly it did not."
"nike The most comfortable shoe I ever owned! Its like walking on a cloud. They are snug and wrap around my feet with both firmness and comfort. Its always hard for mento find comfortable shoes, these are THEE shoes for me!"
"nike Hey, these are great for fit and comfort.  My wife bought me another pair of shoes, I couldn't wait til  I could replace em.  The wife calls these my old men shoes.  But hey I am an old man, and I have earned the right to have these shoes."
"nike I really like these shoes, especially since they have fixed the squeak in this version.  I have wide feet, with a bone spur on little toe and these shoes are very very comfortable all day. I walk at least 4 miles a day.  I have previously always gotten the white color and these are the first black pair Ive had but they fit just as well.  On other brand 4E wide shoes, I have had to cut a slot around the little toe to relieve the pressure but not on these Monarchs."
nike Good shoe for long term on your feet. Watch out for the soles comming unglued if you work or play in or near water often. I've had some that came apart.
"nike The shoes have a very firm shape to them, and they are really comfortable in walking in."
nike Good value. I have to wear this ginormous size and these re better than most.
nike My favorite athletic shoe. Seller ships ridiculously fast. No trip to the store required and I'm lovin' it!
"nike A 'HAIR'.  Just a HAIR small maybe.  Many reviewers for example wrote #1. that they fit 'True to size,' while still others wrote #2. 'Fit as expected.'<br/><br/>Okay.  For me that's a tough one because I'm left to wonder 'Did they EXPECT' the shoe to fit a little small, or a little large and also the 'True to size' part.  I say this because I've bought this that or the other thing with experience buying from that manufacturer and I EXPECTED it to fit small or large SO with that it DID fit as expected.<br/><br/>Whereas if I'd never bought a certain brand before and the size chart gave a specific measurement and I gauged my decision to choose some size because of the information in the chart THEN an item DID or DIDN'T fit ... ALSO as 'EXPECTED.  See where I'm going with this?<br/><br/>So, iF you're POSITIVE that you wear a size 11 BUT your foot is maybe 'just' a little wide BUT not so wide that you have to buy an 11 W for example as opposed to 11 D or M.  (U.S.) then you might want to go with an 11.5 or POSSIBLY even a 12 (that is to say then a half to a full size larger.)<br/><br/>I'm serious, I am NOT yanking your chain here.  These are VERY comfortable.  They have a thick sole.  I stand a full one inch taller in these.  They absorb shock quite well also.  I have a pair of Nike SHOX that I paid around $139.00 for.  The Air Monarch here is WAY more comfortable for just walking around AND they're fine for treadmill. (The SHOX ARE better all around for treadmill for me due to the recovery of first my right knee, then my left: so for the ultimate running shoe for rehab, I would recommend the SHOX in tandem with some very good compression knee sleeves for what that's worth.)<br/><br/>If you have no issues, you just want something almost all purpose, not too pricey (VERY affordable in fact) and nice looking (they don't look cheap at all,) I absolutely highly recommend these. At the same time ... I've lost my train of thought because while inserting the previous sentence I managed to delete an entire paragraph...SO the bottom line is that I highly recommend these."
nike I am very happy to buy this product.<br/>The shipment was very fast and arrived in very good condition.<br/>Thank you.
"nike Great shoes.  The width runs a little tight, but they are very nice shoes."
"nike I always keep a spare pair of these sneakers in a fireproof safe in the event of some sort of a natural disaster !!<br/>Seriously, these are the only sneakers I wear. I've been wearing them (different pair) for over 20 years. I wear them for everything from construction work, for athletics, for boating and for dress. They aren't fancy like my kid's and grandkids wear, but they are incredibly comfortable. So I always keep a spare pair on hand."
nike Seems to be a nice product for the price.  Fits and is well constructed.
nike Always predictable fit and generally a comfortable sneaker fro the price.
nike I wear these shoes almost exclusively.  They always work and wear well.
"nike I love the shoes, but even better I love that they fit when I got them!<br/>I wear a very large shoe, so being able to order them without hunting for a specialty store was a pleasant experience!"
nike Very comfortable snug fit.  Arrived on time without any damage to box.
nike I have a white pair of these and a black pair so this time i got a little bit of both. Very comfortable shoe!!!
"nike I got these because I was tired of Adidas and liked the look.  I have the white/black/red, not the weird looking all black in the picture.  I knew about the squeaking issue, but seemed to be an easy fix.  I tried them on at a local store before ordering from Amazon.  I would have just bought them at the local store, but they were out of my size.  Anyway, these, to me, run a bit small.  I wear 11.5 in almost every brand, but usually need a 12 in Nikes.  These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned, and that includes my current workshoes (Merrill Shiver Moc), which cost well over $100 usually.  Time will tell on the wear and squeak, but after a few days with some heavy walking mixed in, these are great!"
nike My husband loves these shoes and continues to buy then every time he needs shoes.  Laces are to long though.
nike There great sneakers fit and last  love them feel awesome on my feet
nike I have bought these same exact size and width shoes in the blue and white and these ones are a bit smaller. I bought them because they worked so well in the past but I wanted a different color. At first I thought they gave me the wrong width. Ill still wear them but I wont buy this particular one again.
nike I like this shoe and will probably buy it again.  Comfortable fit.
"nike Good Fit and wearable right out of the box without a lot of ""break in"" time."
nike A fantastic shoe. I will be buying more of these in different colors.
nike these sneakers are good for walking but not jogging as they have air in the heels and it punchers and blows out after a few months.another thing is that they make a horrible squeaky noise after the air blows out of them every time you walk on them.so if you want a regular walking sneaker then they are perfect and are extremely comfortable especially if you have lower back pains.but if your a jogger don't buy these as the air will blow out.
nike Nice shoes but be sure to order at least a half size bigger than you usually wear.
nike My son really liked these sneakers years ago.. He asked if maybe they still made them they do.. He was so happy.. very comfortable!
"nike I've bought multiple pairs of these type of shoes over the last decade. They look good, feel comfortable and are affordable."
"nike I know how a shoe fits and feels is subjective depending on the particular shoe and individual, but, for me, these are like pillows on my feet. I am wearing one pair now and have four new pair in the closet."
nike Been through most of the brands of shoes to try to support my arch and put an end to my plantar fasciitis. Bought several other brands before the Nike Air Monarch IV and none of them have the support that these Nikes have. Love these shoes and these are actually my second pair. Superior arch support and snug fit at my correct size. The best part is that my plantar fasciitis is almost completely remedied and I've only had these shoes for a bout a month and half! Definitely will keep these as my daily shoes!
"nike Used these as work/walking shoes, ~10ish miles a day, 6 days a week. They did eventually fall apart but I've found that these last longer than anything else at similar price points."
"nike I absolutely love these shoes!  This is probably my 5th or 6th pair of these shoes, and they are by far the most comfortable sneakers I've ever owned.  They wear well for me and definitely feel like you're walking on air.<br/><br/>I typically wear a pair for a 18 to 24 months, and when they get a little ratty, I use the old pair for around the house/yard and purchase a new pair for wearing in public."
nike Fit perfectly  awesome looking for buying untried off Internet very pleased very comfortable  could not believe how light weight  would definitely recommend to buy
nike Very comfortable and wide.  Good Quality at a great price.  Will buy these again.
"nike Still the ""Old Guy"" shoes that are bought for comfort.  I have been buying them for years and most of them have held up well."
"nike The package arrived in two days, sneakers fit well and were in New Condition! I've spent $65.00 in Khol's for the same pair, a bargain at $49.00.<br/>Dave"
"nike Really great shoes, in a color combo I couldnt get locally."
"nike average quality.  But the squeaking problem is annoying, I would buy again."
"nike Great shoes at a good price.  I was amazed at how quickly they arrived,,,,,,,,,2 maybe 3 days.  I needed a pair of shoes for walking and have owned black monarchs in the past...3 pair....these white shoes are not quite the same but are just as comfortable.  I tried them on and I had very little trouble breaking them in.  The shoes are very comfortable due to the ""air"" and the general great quality of the shoes.  I went to the mall and I couldn't find them at at least 8 stores and I thought  ""what a bummer...my favorite shoes and they don't make them anymore""  I looked on Amazon and there they were and at a very reasonable price."
"nike They look ""clunky"" with a nice, round toe. That being said, they are comfortable and are great to be in for a day of standing and walking!"
nike Had several pairs of these and last long and look good with jeans
nike Shoe fits great just like the ones I get at the store.
nike Like the style. Works well for me who has flat feet.
nike Best prices in town - and they fit just as expected.
nike wear them for work. fits perfect and are comfortable
nike Great quality at a reasonable price...Arrived early.
"nike Nice shoe, fairly light weight and the price is also reasonable"
nike Look great fit great delivery was great - great job
nike Excellent shoes.  Very comfortable and supportive.
"nike Ive had these before which is the reason i bought them, yes they are squicky so just add baby powder under the sole and on top and itll fix that, i got the 4E and dont worry about the  4E(M) its just men, they feel like ur on a cloud"
"nike Love these shoes, fit well and are so comfortable."
nike I have the shoes for a long time now and they are still holding up good
nike Love the style. I use it to go to work everyday.
"nike I own this show right now as a size 11 4E and it was really snug in the beginning.  This new pair is slightly large at a 12 4E, but thicker socks make that issue go away and width-wise is very comfortable.  Good shoe overall, and price is very good compared to retail stores.  Arrived on time, no issue."
"nike comfortable shoe, and it was just what I wanted."
"nike I had purchased shoes like this way back 2001 or so and LOVED them.  I always swore how much support they had, not to mention they are very attractive both on and off :).<br/>The support is still amazing for my arch and heels. However, the sizing seems a bit off, maybe just the new leather, but I don't remember them fitting this tightly.<br/><br/>All in all though, very well made shoe."
"nike My son wears these for work as a bartender. They are sturdy, durable and most important comfortable.  He is on his feet anywhere from 9 to 12 hours at a time and has been wearing these for years and years.  He was looking for an all black shoe and discovered these many years ago.  We are concerned that they will eventually be discontinued so he stockpiles.  He claims they are best shoe for him for any price."
nike the very best walking shoe and comfy too  M.C.
nike Love the new shoes.  They fit great. Great price.
"nike Love the color! These shoes are exactly what I expected. I have purchased these shoes before but in a different color. The fit is as expected. I wish they had more arch support, but all and all a great fit, and I will be buying them again the next time I need shoes."
"nike Love these shoes! This is about my 6th-7th pair! I wear these everywhere and I'm a teacher! They really help my feet take on the stress of on my feet all day. I have other tpes of shoes and even other types of tennis shoes, but nothing compared to the comfort I get with these!<br/><br/>J M Rogers"
nike Son's happy with the shoes.<br/><br/>Rich
nike Second pair of these that I have owned. Great shoe.
nike I love these shoes - they are so comfortable - I wore out my last pair and these are just a little wider and fit perfectly - I hope they continue to make them (seems like when you find something that works well and you really like it it gets discontinued) I am Old-school and cannot stand all the new products made with mesh sides and tops (garbage in my opinion) These are all leather (very good construction - and they look good) and provide good support for foot and heal. Tenstars from me **********
nike Love the shoe but after a while they will develop an annoying squawk.  With all the complaints I'm surprised that Nike hasn't solved this problem.
nike Great fit. Great looking shoe. Amazon come thru again.
nike The shoes arrived promptly as stated. The size and width were correct and the shoes fit perfectly.
nike My grandson loved his Nike shoes. Took them out and put them on right away.  Said they were great looking and extremely comfortable üëç; )
"nike Hard to find a good, simple, supportive white leather sneaker. So nice to find a cold weather alternative to the ubiquitous mesh. Supportive, comfortable, and sharp looking. Good stuff."
"nike These are the only shoes my husband likes to wear. He works on his feet all day (as a cabinet installer) so these fit as they would in the store. The soles do not offer much support, so he always has to put inserts in. I recently bought a pair for myself, and noticed the soles also needing more support. Overall, a great shoe-- and worth the money."
nike Fit as expected.  Feels like it will last for awhile  (strong material) yet it's comfortable.
nike Great Shoe! I am  pleased with these Nike Air Monarch IV. They fit comfortably.
"nike This is a good shoe.  I use these for general, everyday getting around.  They are my main shoes to wear to work, to go out socially and for hikes and pretty much everything else.  The laces loosen up nicely to let the tongue loosen way up around my high arches and the width is plenty sufficient for the wide area around the ball of my foot.  I recently bought one pair to test them out as they looked a bit different than the similar but not exact same Nike shoe I have been wearing for a few years.  After break in, they are excellent so I bought a second pair in order to give each pair time to breathe or to be washed while the other pair is in use.  Need we say Nike quality is always excellent."
nike second pair purchased like first so well
nike Great shoes. Great fit.  Will buy again.
"nike They are a cool shoe ,thank you amazon‚ò∫"
nike Husband loves these... Always fit well.
nike Most comfortable shoes for work I've had so far. Love the comfort
"nike These are a second pair, first bought locally. They are good for my feet bottoms, where I've had issues, and where running and other cross training lighter types just were not cushioned adequately. These are perfect for avoiding that. And they are not heavy for the build. I walk treadmill at 6.0+ elevation, and flexibility is also not an issue. The ""D"" size in these is my wider than average width, while the other models of ""E-4"" etc, were too wide in the store. I waited for two months to be sure the store bought pair were indeed perfect; these from Amazon were true to size, and will last me for years--Grateful to Amazon once again. ~ww"
nike Nice looking - comfortable - good price!
nike Feels great on neuropathy. Super comfortable.
nike My husband is on his feet every day and he loves these shoes - his fourth pair!
"nike These are the shoes that I will buy for years to come.  Previously, I was a Rockport fan.  The last pair that I ordered through Amazon were TERRIBLE.  My feet hurt badly.  I think it was poor arch support.  I tried these Nike walking shoes and they fit great and feel great.  I need wide shoes. The right shoe was a little tight but expanded a little with a few days of wear and are perfect now.  Very happy now."
nike Buy them a full size larger and hope they fit.  They aren't returnable after you wear them.  Beware!
nike It is a good looking show but I normally wear a 9D in most shoes and that is what I ordered but it was too small. I would need a 9 1/2 D in this shoe. I was able to return it with no problem and no return shipping.
"nike Have bought several pairs of Monarchs.  I have wide feet and the 4Es fit better than nearly every pair of athletic shoes I have tried.  Stand up well to abuse and they just keep going.  They are my everyday shoes, even at work."
nike Son loves them. Nikes always wear well.
nike i only were nike. they are great.
nike These shoes definitely run 1/2 size small at least. This might be a personal issue but I couldn't wear these shoes for more then an hour. There appears to be an inside seam in the construction that crossed my pinkie toes in both shoes and caused severe irritation. This purchase was a waste of money for me as I can no longer wear them.
nike The fit was just right. The shoe is comfortable.<br/>I wrote a review earlier.
"nike They look good, feel good, and a good price"
nike They're beautiful I wish they were wider
nike shoes arrived on time and fit great
"nike I've been wearing the Nike Monarch series of shoes for years now.  Until I purchased these they have been the most comfortable and durable shoes I've worn.  Now they're too small, they've developed a squeak when I walk in them and are starting to wear on the bottom.  Very disappointing.  Looks like it's time I find a new brand as my children are also having similar issues with their Nike shoes."
"nike These are great, well built shoes.  Comfortable and long lasting."
"nike Great sneakers,very comfortable and log lasting"
nike Great shoes at a great price
"nike In the past I've bought less expensive sneakers at Sam's Club or WalMart but  they were not very comfortable nor did they last very long...<br/><br/>This time I wanted something a lot better. I have two two bad knees that need replacing and wanted to ease the pain of walking.<br/>So although I've never had a pair of Nike Air Monarchs, I ordered them in hopes of getting a decent shoe that would make my walking easier.<br/><br/>It was a good decision on my part. With basic standard shipping, the Nikes arrived quickly in just several days. The fit and comfort perfect. I gave these a five star rating for quality, looks, comfort. I'll do it again when I need them."
nike They  fit perfectly and I PUT my own orthodics in them and very comfortable for my high arches and metatarsal pain.  .no pain now and will buy another  pair of these shoes when I wear these out.
nike GREAT SHOE &amp; GREAT SERVICE.
nike Husband loves them great price
"nike These are my Dad's favorite shoes, this was his 3rd pair. He asks for them every time his old ones wear out"
nike I am very happy with them.
"nike I love the Air Monarach IV's since they are comfortable to wear and I am currently wearing my third set of this brand of shoes but this new set has been disappointing.  These new shoes have a squeaking sound when walking, running or even when holding in my hand and the sides are squeezed or the bottom of the shoes are pressed."
nike Husbands favorite sneaker
nike Great shoes fast shipping thanks
nike My son loves these shoes.
"nike These shoes are rather heavy, but are reasonably comfortable. The rear portion of the heels wear down fairly soon with my stride. The deep and narrow treads catch and hold chips of rock salt  which tends to be overused on our winter sidewalks. I can fairly quickly remove it with a brisk stream of water in a utility tub or sink."
nike So far great shoe and good support.
nike Too tight!<br/>David Somers
nike They don't fit right and not like the previous 2-3 Air Monarchs I've purchased.
nike Great to have found a show that fits.  How they wear as good as they look.
nike They look good but are stiff and not comfortable.
"nike No squeaks, no issues.  Nice look, feel good.  Light as expected.  Like them a lot."
"nike Ordered the 4e for extra width and they are as expected. Comfortable and easy to slip on with shoelaces tied loosely,"
nike Great product. Have bought several. I replace them when they wear out. Worth every penny.
nike Not as comfortable as other products
"nike When you buy Nike's, you generally know what you're getting into.  You're gonna pay a little too much for a shoe that's generally well-made and has nice comfort features.  These Monarchs here are no exception, aside from the fact that one of the shoes has an air bubble in the ball of the foot area or something that causes a loud squeaking noise when you walk.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to seem imposing to your Stormtroopers when every step you take makes it sound like you've got clown shoes on?  It's really maddening.<br/><br/>Still, they're much more comfortable than my regular boots, so I continue to wear them.  I don't know that I'll buy this particular model again due to the design flaw, however."
nike its too big for me!
nike 3ard pair for me. They are very comfortable and one of the few I have purchased that don't require an after market insole.
nike Great shoe for me on my feet all-day long on concrete very good .
nike kinda like old man Nike shoes tbh
nike Great quality from Nike as always.
nike i love these shows great comfort
nike Very comfortable.
nike very comfortable
"nike I use an insole in all of my shoes, Sole, and this shoe did require that I modify the width of the insole for a proper fit (the insole to seat flat inside the shoe). It is a very nicely made shoe. Also, as I also bought this shoe in black, this shoe seems to be the same fit, Volume and length, 10 1/2 D width, as my ASICS Men's Gel-Foundation Workplace Walking Shoe. Very similar."
nike Ordered a medium was sent a size d<br/>I have a pair just like them in size medium fits great! I AM NOT HAPPY
nike Fits well good quality
"nike perfect fit , quick ship"
nike Very nice shoe
"nike I have bought Air Monarchs for my husband and son for years. Comfortable, reliable, and long lasting."
"nike These are great all-day or ""knock-around"" shoes. You'll wear them every day for their comfort and adaptability. Running, walking and even moderate hiking are fine in these, they offer great support and really take a lot of pressure off your knees and back.<br/><br/>Only gripe is that they're only good for about 8-9 months of nearly every day use, but for the price point they're GREAT!"
nike I returned them
"nike Good sturdy training shoes, leather uppers"
nike Wore them but hurt my feet
nike Kinda bulky.
nike Good quality
nike A bit tight.
nike CHEAP SHOES.
"nike These shoes fit nicely, look nice but I have one issue and that is that they squeak.  It's really odd because they look and feel exactly like every other pair of Nike Air shoes I have.  However both shoes developed a squeak after about a week of wear.  Still wearing them because they are comfortable but not sure I would buy them again."
"nike I've worn this model shoe for years.  Last summer I decided to try a different, more expensive brand and was sadly disappointed.  I normally have to try shoes on before I buy them; but I felt confident these would fit based on past experience and they do.  I don't want to say that I highly recommend them because I don't want them to sell out in my size.  But I do highly recommend them."
nike So far so good...  Pricing was competitive.
nike Great Shoe.
nike I love them.
nike Worked perfect!
nike Came as expected. Decent shoe for work.
nike Nice and comfy
"nike The previous 4 years I've worn through 2 pairs of Brooks Addiction shoes. They're comfortable, provide good support, and can pass as 'business casual' while still wearing like sneakers.  Recently my 2nd pair of Addictions were starting to break down and I realized I was only getting 2 years out of them. They cost twice as much as these Air Monarchs, so I decided to give the Nike's a shot. I've only had the Nike's for 2 or 3 weeks now, but I'm very happy - the benefits of support, comfort, and style (plain black, office-appropriate) is on par with the Brooks. If they can make it two years, I'll continue buying them!"
nike excellent
nike Love the Monarchs!  They are a great shoe and they look terrific.
nike great shoes
nike Best shoe of it's type on the market.  Excellent comfortable and extremely  well  made.  Great !
nike I loved the style and so did my grandson!
"nike Shoes were tight, not comfortable at all, not smooth inside, seam on rt little toe rubs, shoes heavy and bulky.  Gave them to my son-in-law who normally wears 11; these 13's fit him pretty well.  Bought a new pair of newbalance ""Speed Ride"" running shoes that are perfect fit and very light weight, and about the same price.  The newbalance gets 5 stars."
nike Good job
"nike I've always preferred Nike Air's, but these are a little tighter in the toe than the old Airforce 1's.  I do have wide feet."
nike Fit as expected and less expensive than buying at the mall.
"nike Sneakers fit as advertised; it was in excellent condition; fit was comfortable, sturdy, and it works for casual use which is what I wanted."
nike Excellent !!
nike great shoes
"nike Very good sneaker and they look solid. However, 7.5 was too large and 7 was too small....Just amazing!"
nike Perfect fit and comfortable. I'm a big guy so being able to walk without my feet hurting is wonderful.
nike very happy with this shoes.
nike all good
nike Good fit
"nike Very nice economy shoe. I use them for work, Sales Assoc at Dollar General. Comfotable , extremely lightweight bends easily with squats. Seem to be constructed well and should last the way I use them for at least six months which is best to be expected with this price range shoe. Would prefer the Air Nike for comfort but out of my price range now. I will recommend these though just the same."
"nike To fix the squeak, I simply removed the insole and put it again. I didn't even put any kind of powder, like others people recommended. What cause the squeak (I think) is just the glue used to attach the insole to the tennis.<br/><br/>I bought this tennis in 2012 and still use it almost everyday. I even used it once to play tennis on a clay surface. It's  very impressive the durability and comfort of it. I would give it 10 stars if I could."
nike my third pair.  very comfortable and doesn't have all the bling that so many shoes have these days...
"nike One of the few shoes that I can find that fit my feet comfortably (15E) and always last longer than expected. Very happy with the purchase, price and delivery time."
nike I don't recall a width designation/selection.  I may have missed that section/display.
"nike Normally I wear Fila, Jordans, or Chucks/Cons, but these are a good shoe for beating around in.<br/>1. Well built<br/>2. Fit as expected<br/>4. Wide fit as expected<br/>5. Sort of an older looking style, but a good pair of shoes for thrashing around in.<br/>6. Soft comfortable interior fit.<br/>7. The tread is minimal but good enough for wet or dry weather. I would not advise using them on snow."
"nike One of my favorite sneakers to wear, super comfortable and always at great price. They hold up pretty good and them being able to come in wide sizes, makes them a easy choice."
nike Great Product
nike As described. Wide fit was perfect. Good price. I will buy again.
"nike Nice, I'm glad I picked it up!"
nike great
nike Great - as advertised
"nike I have had this brand and style for years.  I ordered the same size I have always worn but these are ""roomier"" then previous versions.  Maybe my feet are shrinking,  but I will be fine in the summer when my feet are not so cold as in winter!  Keep making these qnd I will forever be in style!"
nike My husband loves them!
"nike This was an excellent buy. I have problems with my feet and I must say this shoe is very comfortable, true to size and does not have memory insoles that most of the new shoes do which makes them very uncomfortable for me."
nike Fit my wide foot perfectly
nike A+
nike The right shoe ruptured the air cushion 3 weeks after purchased
nike This is my go-to shoe for knocking around and casual wear.  So far I've had no quality control issue whether I buy 'em at a store or on Amazon.  I wear size 11.5 (USA) which sometimes is hard to find in stores that prefer to stock 11 and 12 but skip 11.5.  Appearance is fine in my opinion - neither flashy nor ugly.
nike great for work
nike shoe is really heavy.
nike good fit
nike the size I bought was a little large when is arrived. but still using with thick socks.
nike Was getting the skechers Felton for a few bucks more it's well worth it I'm a size 12 4e they fit great and are comfortable . They don't have a service shoe sole so they are slippery on greasy restaurant floors but still a good shoe.
nike excellent excellent shoe
nike The length of the sneakers are great but they don't feel wide enough even though I got the 4E which is supposed to be extra wide other than that I love them the soles feel really comfortable I've owned Monarch's before which is why I bought them again because I knew they were a comfortable shoes
"nike Have orthopaedic and diabetic foot conditions which require very wide shoes.  Would have preferred a 5E, but these 4E's will do as they break in.<br/>Good quality shoe, comfortable all day...too sparkling white!.....good arch and side to side support.  Unless an unforeseen problem arises, these may be my ""go to"" shoe from here on out!"
nike fit like a glove.  Shoes are light and comfortable
"nike I have been buying these for about 15 years. Because I am 55 years old and have a problem with arthritis in my right knee, I also put the Dr. Scholl's arthritis inserts in the shoe; that makes a perfect combination for me.  Dr. Scholl's https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M2ADJ3Z?th=1"
"nike Very nice product, Fast shipping."
nike Awesome fit and quality!
nike I have been wearing the Nike air shoes for years and size 8 is always best. This pair shoes a size 8 but way too small. Returning was a breeze and re-ordered 8.5.
nike Excellent!
nike Excellent fit and ver comfy
nike Excellent and comfy
nike Shoes fit right to size.
"nike I bought these for my son as they met the uniform code for his school.  I'm not a fan of all black athletic shoes so I made sure he had a back up pair of shoes to wear when he wasn't at school...turns out he loves these black shoes the most and wears them all the time- even outside of school.  He is a 13yo boy and they have held up great, just as I would expect of a Nike shoe."
nike Full Nike Air Sole
nike LOVE IT
nike Bought these for my son he has complained so far that they are too narrow so Im hoping after a little while he can break them in so they stop squeezing his feet
nike I have bad knees and these Monarch Air shoes are the best I've found. I never see black pair in any local stores.
nike Feel awesome on your feet
"nike Light weight and comfortable. The back seems just a bit shorter at my ankle than I would like but its still comfortable. I use these for exercising at work so I dont wear them for long, just for a jog then I take them off again. I picked them because they resemble the steel toed shoes we are supposed to be wearing at work. Shh!"
"nike I wear these as work shoes (retail) and they're great. Very comfortable and supportive soles; I don't feel as stiff after a day of work as I normally do.<br/><br/>The width is incredible! I'm a 15EE usually, and its a challenge to find shoes that fit at all let alone comfortable ones."
nike nice shoe wide like it is should be haven't wore them but twice so for so good
nike nice
nike The arch took a bit to get used to for me. Also I have now had the shoes for 6 months and one of them has started to squeak when I walk.  Over all I do like the shoes.
nike Very comfortable for walking.
"nike Tight.  Ordered size eleven, but these are tight.  So, you see, these are tighter fitting than what I had expected in terms of fit."
nike Fits well and is comfortable
nike LOVVes them
"nike Husband says they are good fitting shoes that are comfortable to wear all day, even when doing a lot of standing or walking."
nike The hard outsole is killing any comfortable and light weight cushioning and feeling coming from the Air-feature as the name insinuate. This is like a not-clever design defect not a manufacturing defect. Doesn't give you what you bought the shoes for!
nike Really nice shoe. I bought it for my son. He didn't like them so I have a new pair of shoes for ME.
nike They are to wide in the front.
nike love it
nike Fit great. I wear these shoes for work. They are the only shoes that don't hurt my feet standing and walking on concrete all day.
"nike I didn't think that a Nike product could be so comfortable, yet durable at such a moderate price. I am on my feet for many hours out of the day...whether I'm walking or running; and nearly 6 months into my purchase, the shoes still hold up. I plan to buy an extra pair for working out in the gym."
nike I use these for work during the decent weather months. Have gone through a few pairs over the years.
nike Thanks
nike Husband loves his Nike Mens Air Monarch Iv Running Shoes
"nike Awesome shoes, they look great and they are extremely comfortable"
nike The most comfortable shoe that I have ever worn. Friends are tired of me saying it. Bought a second pair. Reasonable price.
nike There my fourth pair
"nike Really comfortable shoes. I got the 4E ones on accident, I thought I was going to have to return it but to my surprise they fit perfect. I am 6'0 and a stocky build. So if you are a bigger guy, definitely check the 4E ones out."
"nike I have a very wide foot and arthritic joints.  These shoes have a very wide fit in the EEEE size, extra room for my feet and plenty of padding.  I was pleased to find this shoe in white leather since Nike currently makes mostly dark nylon colors in this style.  I wanted white leather.  This is a very comfortable shoe and looks good enough to wear most places that I go.  Will buy again as long as I can find the white leather."
nike its so nice my son like it its comfy and its came on its time thanks amazon
nike Exactly what my 92 year old grandfather wanted. He's happy with his shoes and may have me order him a 2nd pair.
nike good quality
nike Bought these to use solely on my treadmill. They are perfect for the purpose. Fit snug but good. 0 friction points. The sole was what I was concerned about (not being able to visualize). I shopped under the category (cross trainer) because I wanted a flat sole. Got exactly what I wanted.
nike Always a favorite work shoe. Excellent arch support. Could have gone a half size larger from what the foot size gadget at the shoe store read.
"nike I wear these shoes at work in the kitchen they provide excellent comfort, ample gription on the floor. My feet last longer with these shoes compared to a stiff leather kitchen shoe. I use an orthotic and wear thick soled socks, these shoes provide plenty of room for all that. My last pair of these shoes sqeeked and I bought a white pair and have not run into that problem. This pair is too new to know yet if that will be an issue."
nike Great shoe.
nike Great for tennis!
nike these are great shoes the last ones lasted 5 years.
nike Second pair purchased. Great for diabetic quality footwear.
nike They did not fit. Too large.
"nike These are exactly as described. The 4E means extra wide, but 3E was not available so I went for these.<br/>I now have a fresh bounce in my air step.<br/>Best Regards,"
"nike Nike always makes great shoes, The work shoes are fantastic. They have the memory foam insole, Very comfortable to wear all day. The fit is perfect. I really like black sneakers, I really love these shoes, perfect for me and I love them."
nike Great fit. A little heavy but does the job.
nike Really nice quality look in person.<br/><br/>My 13 year old like these so much I caught him cleaning them! First time ever that I have seen him do this. Holding up remarkably well. My son has owned them 3 months now with almost daily use and they are in great condition. By this time he has normally completely worn out his shoes as hes so hard on them. Definitely recommend.
nike Love the style and color. The 4X fit my flat feet just right.
nike Love these shoes! This is my Second pair!
"nike So I've had 4 pairs of these, great shoes. I am pushing 325 pounds and a wood worker and these last me 8 months easy, wearing 16-18 hours a day."
nike It's my husbands favorite shoe. Great arch support! He really likes the color combination too.
nike great shoe!
nike A great shoe. I have been purchasing this model for years; the 4E width fits my foot. Can only hope that Nike makes this shoe for another 20+ years.
"nike I suffer from plantar fasciitis and I am on my feet all today.  In the past, I have found Nikes to give great support.  Lately, however, the comfort as gone down.  I would try another brand if you the same issue as me."
"nike I work in as a primary care provider and am on my feet constantly. These provide the cushion I need and are ""neat"" enough to wear with slacks and a button-down shirt. A little bulky feeling and the fit is on the large size, but overall I'm pleased with these."
nike These were cool before shoes had names.<br/>Life is too short to wear bad shoes!
nike GOOD PAIR OF SHOES
nike Fits exactly as I expected. Great product.
"nike I never notice they are on. They are that comfortable. I use these at work, and wear with my suit... Perfect!"
"nike This is a shoe style I have worn for years, but Nike seems to be phasing it out. I have not been able to find them in my size in multiple stores. So I was pleased to find them on Amazon. They are just what I expected as far as size, comfort and reasonable cost."
nike üòòüòòüòòüòò
nike The feel amazing. I wear the for work where I am on my feet all day for up to 10 hours on a concrete floor. I do a lot of walking around and they help my feet and my back.
"nike Love the sneakers, very comfortable!"
nike They fit very well and it is a really nice looking shoe (white and grey)!  Order 1/2 size up.  If you wear a 10 order a 10.5.
"nike I am 6 feet tall and 215lbs with a slightly wide foot, and flat feet, and this shoe is very comfortable. Just as comfortable as my 25$ dr scholls shoes from walmart, but I wanted something more name brand. the black and white ones look great in person. I like how the inside has cushioning on the sides, and how I can leave the shoe strings tied and slip them on and off with ease. And did I mention these are very comfortable. I have no squeaking in my shoes"
nike I love these extra wide shoes.
nike been wearing these for years  eliminated my leg pain  look good and hold up good
nike good
"nike My husband wears these shoes to work - he is on his feet throughout the day. According to his pedometer, he's averaging about 5 miles per day. This is walking on concrete. With how much he walks, you can imagine how important good fit and comfort are! These shoes are perfect.<br/><br/>Hubby loves the shoes so much that this is his second pair. He wore the first pair for 1 year."
nike Fit perfect and felt good right out of the box..
nike These pair of Nike Air Monarch IV is a waste of money. They are not comfortable to me and they squeak so bad it annoys anyone around you. I have been wearing Nike shoes since the 80's but this will be my last purchase of a Nike product.
nike Good shoes
nike Great support and comfort. Bought them for working on a concrete shop floor. Been great so far after 1 week. Bought the new balanve 910v3 and they lasted 6 months. These are already feeling like the right choice.
nike These ar replacements for the very same shoe. The originals were fine
nike They come in a great variety of sizes which was my initial interest.
nike Best shoes peroid
nike My husband loves the shoes. Very comfortable and was a perfect fit.
"nike The Training/Running shoes are a perfect product from the firm that produces them. However, I should have gotten a size 7 instead of 7.5, which could have been a perfect fit. All my friends are asking me as to where I bought it from, meaning that it is a perfect product as I said above.<br/><br/>Happy Trails!<br/><br/>Charles"
"nike These shoes are very nice. However, the right shoe was not manufactured properly as there was some type of protrusion on the right-front that pushed against my toes. My right foot is not larger than my left foot and I've never had a pair of shoes that both did not fit properly; therefore, it has to be a manufacturing defect. I would have liked to have these shoes but the right shoe was unwearable. I had to return them."
nike great shoe Comfortable
nike I've been wearing these for 13 years. Good price and typically fast delivery. Thanks.
nike I have owned 3 pair of earlier Air Monarch models which were absolutely wonderful. This pair however has not lived up to the same expectations. I purchased these exclusively to wear at work(hospital). After a little over one month all of the air has completely gone out the air chamber and now they really hurt my feet while wearing them even after adding gel insoles. This is horrible. I would like to return them but present time is past the return window.
nike I really can't say anything bad about the shoe. It's fit and finish is good as most Nike's. I work on my feet for ten 12 hours a day and they are light and mostly comfortable. The down side for me is they seem to rub my pinkie toe on both feet. Most of the time I don't have that problem with shoes. Still not sure if it's the shoes or maybe my feet are just shaped different than most.
nike Fits perfectly.  Only shoe  I  can wear everyday and not have my feet hurt.
"nike Only gave them 4 stars because they are not quite as well made as my white ones.<br/>I suppose anything that comes from the orient is going to have some issues.<br/>I like them and can wear them all day working/walking, but as I said, not the same quality I expected."
nike Item was as advertised and arrived promptly
nike They are not as comfortable as they used to be.
nike Great shoes for the price...!
nike Very comfortable but a little heavy
nike I have been weari g this shoe for many years now as these are about the only shoe im really comfortable in for the moment i put them on..
nike very pleased.
nike Great shoe for my running/jogging needs.
"nike Quality product, size is just too small for me. Delivery time was sooner than I thought so that's always a plus!"
nike The wearer has gotten many complements on these shoes.
nike Not sure if this is a manufacturing defect but there is a bump that is part of the mold in the front that constantly presses against my pinky toes from the outside.  I can feel the bumps when I run my fingers along the hard surface inside the shoe that my toes lean against.  This makes wearing the shoe unbearable after a few minutes.
nike I love these shoes. Just like the pair I use to have with a little style update.
nike I purchased these to replace the other Nike Monarchs I owned.  I had them for years.  These fit great and are comfortable.  I've put a lot of miles walking in them since they arrived.  They are comfortable and provide great support.  I prefer the black / black color profile because I can wear them with anything.
"nike Great Sneaker! I've always worn newbalance, but I have been disapointed that they dis-continued the V3's, and the V4's are just not the same? Was a little skeptical with the Nike's cause I have a wide foot! They fit great, and I actually think they give me better foot support too...just ordered<br/>a new pair!"
nike The sneakers arrived in a regular shoe box that was squashed. The box was inside a plastic bag. My bag had black tire marks on it like someone rode over it. The sneakers felt to tight  the first time I put them on. The Air cushion wasn't as soft as other pairs. I called Amazon and sent them back.<br/>I've bought 10 pairs of Monarchs in the last few years and never had a problem.
nike The best made leather heavy duty shoe for walking and standing at work very supportive and well made.
"nike Having Type 2 Diabetes I need a wide, comfortable sneaker and these fit the bill. Will buy again. Only wish I could find them in a 2E vs 4E."
"nike My husband has worn the Air Monarch trainer shoe for years for his gym workouts.  They run a bit narrow, so he wears a wide width rather than the traditional medium width he wears on other shoes.  They fit well, give good support and wear well."
nike They're shorter than my past numerous pairs of the same shoe.  Bunched up at the toes.  I will have to order in size 12 next time instead of 11.5
nike Husband loved his shoes he wore them while traveling and said they were very comfortable.
nike The left shoe of the set is made differently in some way such that the vein on the top of my foot receives noticeable pressure.  I have to adjust the left shoe's tongue to attempt to compensate for the uncomfortable feeling.  Never had this occur with a pair of shoes before.  The right shoe provides a normal fit.
nike AAAA++++
nike These run very small. I normally wear 10.5 mens. Ordered 10.5 was too short. Sent them back at my expense. Ordered 11s and they were too narrow. Sent back again at my expense. When the credit came thru they had deducted $8 from the refund in addition to my paying the shipping back. Long story short order a larger size
nike Way way too narrow
nike I have been buying these shoes for my husband for years for work. He is on his feet most of the day and is required to wear black shoes. These are the best fitting and most  durable shoes we have found. He is picky about the arch support and says they are good for this arches.
"nike use to buy these back years ago , never looked at amazon for sneakers, thanks amazon love the Nike monarch fit well so comfortable !"
"nike Great shoes&gt; I normally wear an 11 1/2 wide in other shoes, but the 12 M fits perfect. These are some of the most comfortable shoes I've had in years. If they continue to be this comfortable I will probably continue to buy Nike in the future."
"nike Great product. High quality craftsmanship. Comfortable.<br/><br/>Only drawback is they ""squeak"" when you walk."
nike Nice looking but they were too big so I have returned them.
nike These were for my husband.  He had tried some on in the store and knew that he had to order a size up.  Problem solved.  Great fit.  Very comfortable shoe.  This is his 3rd pair.  He loves them.  We will buy again when he needs them.  Thank you.
"nike Continues to be my all time favorite shoe.  The re-enforced eyelets, the solid black color and the quality that lasts a long time."
"nike Many years ago I was severely injured and I have to be careful about what I wear on my feet. I originally bought a pair of these shoes because I trust the brand and they had these in my size. I was a little nervous about whether or not they would be comfortable for me to wear. Well, I liked them so much after I got to wear them I bought a second pair. My wife asked me about them after she has injured her leg riding and needed a more comfortable shoe for a while. I bought her a pair and she loves them as much as I do."
nike Excellent shoes for our wide feet!
"nike Great shoes! Still working them in, but very comfortable!"
nike Great shoes
nike Nice and comfortable.
nike Good looking shoe and is very comfortable.
nike Great training shoe as designed. Good fit and comfortable to wear. Thanks!
"nike Replaced the exact same make/model I wore for over 1,000 miles.  No, I am not kidding.  Started using the old pair exclusively for my workouts post-divorce and the other pairs couldn't hold up to the abuse.  I still rotate between the old and new Air Monarch IV pairs, using the new pair 75% of the time."
nike Excelentt
nike I find this to be a great sneaker and I've been buying them for years. An oddity of this sneaker is the 'soul squeak' which is consistent and pretty much there for the life of the shoe. Ninjas will not like this footwear. Lifetime squeak: I know it's time for new sneakers when the squeak goes away. Couple this sneaker with some gel souls (increase your purchase size by 1/2) and this is the perfect sneaker in my opinion.
nike Perfect!
"nike This is an inexpensive ""black"" shoe, that let's me work in the IT field, and support multiple buildings in my city, without getting called out for not being dressy enough.  They are comfortable for long wear, and provide plenty of support when moving 90+ and 150+ lbs servers and printers around"
nike Great shoes
"nike I have been wearing Nike Air Monarch shoes since they were first introduced. This is generation four and I am glad that the sole pattern has been changed. Generation 3 was squeaky after some wear on the bottom. Otherwise, the fit and comfort are as the have always been. I am on my feet for up to 14-15 hrs a day when I work and these have been the best shoes I have found for my type of work and since they are all black, they pass as dress shoes even in a suit when a suit is required"
"nike My husband is smaller than average, &amp; has a hard time finding size 7.5.  He is very happy to have these shoes."
nike More comfortable than any of my NBs that I have bought over the years.
"nike The shoes size was too small compared to my current Nike shoes with the same 8.5 size. Physically the shoes in my opinion were too ""big and clunky"". Not to be overly critical but when I put them on they reminded me of clown shoes."
nike Great Shoe
nike The shoes have greatly reduced the pain that I was suffering due to fallen arches in my feet.
"nike These shoes fit great if other shoes punch on the sides..,,"
"nike Timely arrival, replaced prior Air Monarch, new, happy with purchase"
nike These are my favorite sneakers. I buy two pair a year and wear them all the time. Very comfortable.
nike Very comfortable shoes. I've purchased this type repeatedly over the years and have never been disappointed. My only complaint is that they eventually tend to squeak over time.
"nike I knew that they would still be a bit snug since I have a 6E wide foot,  but they feel great.  I will be getting another pair.  They have said that they will start to squeak,  but so far,  so good.  Lots of Pickle Ball with these shoes."
nike somewhat large
"nike These are the longest lasting comfortable shoes.  I have tried other styles, but prefer the monarchs the most."
"nike Bought a pair of these 10 years ago and wore them until they literally fell apart. Was very pleased to find the exact same ones (and for about the same price I paid for the first). One reviewer's kid apparently called them ""old man shoes"" but they make me feel young, so yeah...."
"nike I have a great deal, very light and comfortable, excellent quality and brand name. I am sure I will put a lot of miles for years to come.<br/>Thank you- I do recommend the 4E and still looks very professional. I will give you 10 stars"
nike This is my 8th pair of Nike Air Monarchs and they are the most comfortable sports shoe I have ever purchased. I train hard and these shoes take a beating - great product - 100% recommended.
"nike Not a big shoe guy, but these are by far the best shoes I have ever owned.  As other reviews state, they are a little heavy, but it's not an issue.  GREAT shoe."
"nike I usually get a size 9 but decided to get a 9 1/2 based on the fit of my last pair of Nike shoes(Air Max Tailwind).  I think the width on these is a bit narrow.  I have worn them all day 4 or 5 times now and have a couple of spots that are bothering my feet, small toe both feet and a little bothersome just below the big toe on the side.  I've never had to order extra wide before but I'm beginning to think that I may have to in the future.  Hopefully they'll stretch out some.  I don't know if my feet are spreading due to getting older or shoes are shrinking.  Maybe its time to go into a store and get fitted for the next pair."
"nike Same shoe as ordered 1 1/2 years ago by my husband. He loves them, always will I think. And Amazon makes it easy to find the same thing again with the purchase history. I will be buying them again, in about 1 1/2 years I would guess."
"nike When I bought these Shoes, I didn't buy them because they were running Shoes, as I can't run because of my Plastic Ankle, When I tried these on after taking them out of the box, I was very glad of the Comfort, being that I'm a Diabetic # 2, these Shoes made my feet feel very good."
nike I  bought  these  as  a  gift  for  my  nephew  because  he  can  only  wear  shoes  with  a  good  arch. When  they  got  here  we  were  shocked  to  see  they had  a  better  arch  than his  air Jordan's. Mind you  I'm  on  a  limited  income  so  he  takes  care  of  his  stuff. I  highly  recommend  these  shoes  to  anyone  that  wants  a  quality  shoe at a  discount  shoe price
"nike shoes are quite comfortable, not the best for looks but compared to the skechers i have worn for the past 3 years these things are great, the toe box from mid arch forward is taller and wider than usual so your toes dont feel so cramped but your foot doesnt slip around in them"
"nike After trying many other shoes, this is always the one we go back to for my husband. He has back problems and works on concrete all day and wears threw almost any shoe in about 6 months. These don't exceed that, but until he does bust the seams in these at least they give good support, are comfortable, affordable, stable and keep his feet dry. With his problems with shoes that's about all we can ask for."
nike my grandson loves them
nike Excellent cross trainers!!!!
"nike I have flat feet so I need a shoe that doesn't have a large arch for me this is why I buy this sneakers, I can tell you good quality."
nike same shoe as I had before.  Love em
"nike This was a replacement pair of Nike ""walking"" sneakers that I owned for 4 years. Quality and fit of the pair I ordered through Amazon were exactly as I hoped. Well made and comfortable for my 6 to 8 mile looong daily dog walks. Recommend."
"nike Very nice looking shoes.  They are a gift.  However,  I tried them on, and they were comfortable for me.  My friend will love them.  Nikes price too be a little expensive, but, last for ever.  They are sturdy shoes.  Worth the money."
"nike nice, but does not compare to comfort of sketchers."
"nike Again, perfect !!!!"
"nike Ordered what I had already used for tennis after I had worn down the bottoms to almost hole in my other pair.  I got good use from the old ones so bought them again.  I can't answer the ""hold long to wear comfortably"" since I only use them for 2 to 3 hours playing tennis."
"nike My husband loves these sneakers and Amazon allows me to buy at a good price,will buy again"
"nike I always buy NIKEs one size larger than my dress shoes and they fit perfectly. This is a great, comfortable shoe!"
"nike I like the design and color, but the shoe wasn't comfortable at all. It's a little heavy at first but you get used to it. I put the shoes on and they felt a little rigid, but I knew I had to wear them a bit so they could conform to my feet so I bit my tongue. But throughout the day I felt even worse then my previous shoes which basically had no insole. By the end of the day I just wanted to take them off. I appreciate the extra room for wide footed people but other than that the shoe was a bust. I hope I can get my money back."
nike I've been wearing brand and style for years. Great shoe great price.
"nike I like the fit except for one part that made all the difference to return them.  My ankles were rubbed by the sides of these running shoes.  Length and width I ordered were fine.  Had to return them because of the ankle rubbing.  Honestly, it's been hard for me with Nike.  Amazon did a great job with customer service and shipping though!"
nike GREAT NO SOCK SHOE OR SOCK SHOE
nike Great product. Great seller. Great price.
"nike I have been using The Nike  monarch  since 2008 and this is my fourth pair. I think of them more  as a cross trainer , great for walking, running, lifting , everyday use ! The monarch IV has bin up dated with a more dense/ aggressive outter sole incorporating full length air cushion , extra air slots , padding in sides and inner soles , very comfortable"
nike The fit was my biggest concern. It fit exactly as expected. Your normal sneaker size will work just fine if your feet are a little wide. You do not need to size up with this one.
nike Just what I wanted. Perfect fit. Very pleased.
nike Just as described! but a bit shorter than I wanted. Great shoe!
"nike i have the air monarch IV in white, black, and red. I liked them so much that I purchased this black leather pair... these are SO HUGE I can't even wear them.  A waste of money  because I can't return them from the seller."
"nike These are the best shoes I've found for my feet.  Feet are flat, and I have to wear orthipedic arches for support.<br/>Glad I could find them here.<br/>UPDATE: 2nd pair bought.  I like buying them here, always wondered whose stinky feet tried them on before me in a store."
"nike This is the second pair of this model I've owned.  I walk five miles a day on an asphalt track.  These shoes are comfortable, keep my feet cool, and have good arch support.  I estimate I have walked 800 miles in the older pair and they are holding up well."
nike Comfortable sneaker . Very nice price . Not popular among the younger generation. Which I don't care . I'm 45 o/y . Its made by Nike at least name brand  . Some reviews says it squeaks while you're walking? Doesn't happen with me . I like this sneaker .definitely serves the purpose. Which is an affordable footwear that looks good and feels great .
nike Perfect
nike matches my old feet.
"nike Feels a little large even with thick socks, but i will keep it."
nike annoying seam at the back heal that caused a blister.  A bit of gaffers tape salved the problem
"nike Very nice shoes I even reordered the wider size thinking this would help but they are still a little snug hopefully after wearing them for short time you'll fit more comfortably , but honestly I was hoping for wider size would be more comfortable right from the start ?"
nike Good waking shoe for decent price.
nike happy
nike My husband loves these shoes. He said they are very comfortable. I will be ordering other colors for him.
"nike Over the years I have owned over a dozen pair of these.  They are comfortable, cushioned, durable with good sole grip. Once I found them I kept going back and buying them.  I walk all day so my feet, ankles, knees and hips take a pounding. I have less pain with the Air Monarch.  Although the Air Monarch III was in my opinion a better shoe, the Air Monarch IV is better than all the others I've tried.<br/>I bought three pair for me. This pair is for my son."
nike My husband has two pairs of Nike air monarch shoes and he loves them and they fit perfectly.
"nike These shoes are great!  These are wide enough not to cramp your toes. The arch support is so good, you won't need orthotics. Shoes are durable, good grip and light weight!  Glad I found them.  This is my second pair."
nike Really like these shoes
nike Very supportive and look great!
nike Great sneakers with speedy service delivery. I only wish they had size 9 wide in other colors other than white or black. Would order again as I have before.
nike It's a good fit and a great shoe...I wear this shoe to work on a production line standing 10 to 12 hours per day....I have tried other brands of shoes but this by far has been the best.
nike They look like old people with foot problem shoes. My kids and wife make fun of me when I wear them. ‚òπÔ∏è
nike Good comfortable walking shoe.  Leather squeaks while walking which is a little annoying.  But comfort beats squeak.
"nike Best tennis shoes I've ever bought for my husband's 4E wide foot!  I don't know what I would do without these Nike Air tennis!  They are extremely comfortable and have excellent arch support.  He goes through a pair every 2 weeks or so, so I wish they were less expensive, but worth it to know he is wearing a great shoe!"
nike All leather and warm for  the  winter.
"nike Great looking shoe. Fits a tad bit small for me since my feet are a little wide, between D and E. Not too uncomfortable however and feel they will get better with wear."
"nike Fantastic, I can wear them all day everyday, they are that comfortable of a shoe, had 4 pairs before these that usually last a couple of years.  Plenty of support in the arch, had other brands and nothing came close in comfort."
nike Great item and price
nike It is a bit tight for a 12.5
"nike Excelente, muchas gracias!!"
"nike better arch support than I expected, but not top tier arch support. Solid outer coating makes for a very sturdy shoe, but it won't last long, the outer edge is not sewn. Still much higher quality than the price, so 5 stars."
nike Great shoe for a responsible price. My 10 year old is tough on these and the last pair he had lasted 6 months. Two thumbs up
nike I am a UPS Deliver driver and these are my non winter delivery shoes (I use boots in the winter).  So far they are a comfortable fit which is important due to the fact I average about 14 miles per day walking.  Will note later how well the tread wares.<br/><br/>FIT:  Nike tends to fit about 1/2 size smaller then other shoes so plan accordingly.
"nike I'm a big fan of the Monarch line, they fit well and look good. These were purchased for my sore feet which run around the office all day long. Very happy with the arch support of these shoes and the consistent fit as well. This is my 5th pair over the years and they wear well and last a good length of time."
nike Have worn Nike Air Monarchs for about 15 years.  They are my favorites.  Over the years have increased the width to a 4E to provide more toe room.  Works great.
nike Just like the pair that they were replacing
nike Very comfortable.
nike They are very comfortable
nike Excellent fit and design.
nike My husband loves them.  We ordered a half size bigger than usual and they fit perfectly so I guess they run a tad small. They look good and very comfortable.
"nike My husband usually wears a 13 but I had to order a 14 for these to fit.  However, the shoes were not what he was looking for so we returned them for a refund with no issues."
nike Been wearing this same style shoe for 14<br/>Years.
"nike I bought these once and after a couple years of regular use they started squeaking really loudly. The air at the bottom was farting out so I'd walk down the hallways at work *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak*, .. so embarrassing. But I loved the comfort and look of the shoes, so to fix the *squeaking* I just bought a new pair. Let's hope this new pair lasts as long (a year or two) without squeaking."
"nike It's a really good shoe overall. I don't think they should advertise this as a running shoe though. It's a little to heavy for that. It is comfortable, but does squeak pretty bad after about a month of wear. I think its squeaking along the point where a disc shaped part of the sole meats the rest of the sole. If you don't mind he squeak it's worth it. Fair product."
nike Great tennis shoes our 4th pair
"nike I am in love with the MONARCH model.<br/>I have been wearing them for 5 consecutive years.<br/><br/>Good to find them on Amazon, as they are no longer sold in my country. They were replaced by these cheap looking plastic ones that are sold for excessive money and are not comfy. (damn you Nike Mexico)"
"nike Not exactly stylish, but surprisingly supportive and comfortable.  The last pair I purchased at a sports store and they needed an additional cushioned insole, but not these. I would gladly recommend them."
"nike Have done this once already, but the item was as expected and looks great! Fits as expected, feels good.."
nike I purchased them as a gift for my husband &amp; he loves them. He wears them to the gym &amp; claims they are the best tennis shoes he has ever worn. Thank you.
"nike These shoes are comfortable and look fine, but a few months after wearing them occasionally the right shoe has developed a horrid squeaking sound. It's loud enough that some of my co-workers have commented on it. These are going to Goodwill tomorrow. I cannot recommend these shoes for any reason. I believe there are a few other recent reviews about the same issue, so it may be that the quality was recently reduced to further the profits."
"nike After searching online and in stores for this Particular NIKE Tennis Shoe, I came to AMAZON and Searched for it. It is The ONLY Style of NIKE that my Husband will wear so I was THRILLED to find that Amazon not only had this Style, but that they were also OVER $15.00 LESS than Most other online stores AND Department stores that I went to Sell them for!! YAY for AMAZON!!  Don't hesitate buying on AMAZON for Name Brand Merchandise.....It IS the ""REAL"" Deal!!!!"
nike The shoes fit good and fill great on my feet.
nike Very comfortable to wear.

nike Fit well
"nike I purchased this for my son and he loves them. He wants another pair in a different color but although the price was right, I'm a disabled single mother on a limited income so these were a humongous splurge but he deserves it."
nike I use Nike Monarch 4E more 8 years.It is the best model for me.
"nike This purchase was a gift.  The shoes fit well and the width was extremely important, but that too was just fine.  I can't answer the ""how long can you wear"" question since I am not the one wearing them.  I would hazard a guess that they will also be fine, but if that proves incorrect, I will revisit and adjust this review."
nike Bought them to work in. Saving my arches and angles.
"nike Awesome comfort, just hope they don't start squeeking like the last pair or Air Monarch's I bought direct from<br/><br/>Awesome comfort"
nike The shoe is a little larger than expected but I'm keeping them. They are sturdy and my back feels good when walking in them.  They are hot. There's not much for venting the shoe so my feet sweat.
nike Nice
nike Great shoe. Very comfortable and very good support.Well worth the money.
nike We buy at least four pairs of these a year. They fit well and look good so we keep buying them despite the fact that they flatten out pretty quickly (after about 3 months of wear) and they squeak when they start to wear about a month in. Glad that I can now just buy them here and get them in a couple days without dealing with shipping or tax or trying to find a store that carries them and is in stock. Thanks.
nike Great sneakers.  They fit as expected.
"nike They were as ordered, but my daughter preferred heavier work shoes now that her pair like these wore out.  I returned them for a prompt refund.  Her job change had made this type shoe unusable for work."
nike This is my second pair bought brand new..had bought this same Nike used one...after experiencing the comfort ability..i decided to order a brand new pair because of its excellent finishing and comfort.
"nike The only disappointment in these shoes is that the toebox is slightly narrow. Otherwise, my feet are absolutely thrilled. I've purchased at least a dozen pair over the years and have yet to find a more comfortable sports shoe."
nike I am a repeat buyer....  I usually wear a size 11 but find that a size 11.5 fits me very well.  Great shoes.
nike They are a great shoe. Even with my Prime subscription shipping took 4 days and since they are too small I'm going to give them to my mom.
nike I like these shoes. Look nice and feel good. The only negative is the laces are not quite high / back enough to allow getting a snug fit on my heels. Other Nike's I wear are just fine fit-wise. Note I have thinner-than-normal heels.
nike I like these sneakers I use them as my work shoes. They are very comfortable.
"nike Excellent shoes, thank you very much"
nike Very comfortable.
nike Put these puppies on and felt sweet on my feet. Considering the thickness of the soles shoes were light. First day out walked along concrete city for 5 hours and feet didn't hurt or feel tired. My job requires me to walk a lot. Soles took a 6 month beating before wearing out and there was no material separation anywhere. I'd buy again.
nike Great shoes but should have ordered the 4E instead of the D. My bad.
nike I recently had knee replacement surgery and was looking for a pair of shoes that would give me good support during therapy and into the future. After reading reviews of the shoes I ordered a pair which fit great and have the support I was looking for.
nike Only sneakers that I like that comes in wide
nike THEY SQUEAK!!! I don't like the way they fit up top they're too loose. As I walk the ankle socks are slowly pulled down into the shoe I won't be buying these again.  I don't consider these cross trainers either.
nike Very comfortable and seemingly durable shoes. Simple and sweet design. Very pleased.
"nike My husband works for UPS so is on his feet for 12 or more hours a day.  Jumping in and out of his truck really is hard on his feet and knees and these are the best shoes he has found so far.  They last a  good 6 months with daily wear and tear before he has to replace them, but that's longer than other shoes he has tried."
"nike I usually wear 11.5M in almost everything but I should have ordered 12M they are just a little on the snug side across the ball of the foot, heel is fine, toe room is fine."
nike my husband owns three pair of the shoes because he loves them so much.  very lightweight and extremely comfortable.
"nike These are my go to shoes for comfort, working out, and casual wear. I've bought numerous Monarchs over the years, and I'm especially glad to find the 12.5 size which local stores around me do not stock."
nike nice
nike I haven't had a pair of Nike in years I just don't know why I stop buying them They fix great and I know they will last a long time because all my last pair did.I am so happy that I looked on amazon for shoes because the price was great.O ya that's why I did bye Nike the prices were to high for me in stores well thanks to amazon I know were to bye all my products at a great price and fast delivery.I don't have to wast gas and my time in stores.Thank you amazon for your great products.
nike Was a gift. He is very happy with the shoes. Now using then as his Sunday best shoes lol
"nike Have had trouble finding shoes that fit jut right at the stores.  If fit in the width, the heel is wide or vice versa.  I have an old pair of this shoe that fit well, I could not find in a nearby store in my size so ordered online.  Fits good."
nike Paid $200. For a pair of SAS specialty made shoes and my feet got worse. Been wearing these shoes for 2weeks and now I can make it through most of my shift without added pain. Can't fix my foot problem but makes it a lot bearable and at almost 1/4 the price.. Thanks  Nike....
nike My husband's favorite athletic shoes. So glad to have found them on Amazon!
nike I bought this for my son for school. It's the middle of the term and I'm very happy with this purchase.
"nike I've worn Air Monarch IV for the past several years. They are great to wear if your work requires you to run around, and not look like you are wearing sneakers. I've tried other brands of the same kind of shoe (black cross trainer)  but they did not last as long."
"nike Always comfortable,  we purchase these shoes time and again.  My husband will not be happy if this style is ever discontinued."
nike I have never purchased shoes on line but this was just perfect fit. Very satisfied with the speed that I received them. They fit just right and very comfortable. Thanks!
"nike Good ol' plain white Nike shoes. Nothing fancy or garish about them and just the usual Nike swoosh on the side. Fit and feel is great, no problems after wearing them all day at work. No squeaks noticed. If you're looking for shoes that are simple and basic (in the good sense) then these will fit the bill."
"nike I bought half a size up and appreciate the extra comfort as a result.They are not all that attractive but are OK.A shank may have made them better, but the support is still quite good.Mine don't squeak!"
nike It fits well and it appears to be very comfortable. I am pleased with this purchase. I will buy more shoes from this seller in the future.
nike Exactly as described and pictured. My husband says they fit as expected and seems very happy with them.
nike shoes fit comfortable fit as expected
nike Fit perfect from day 1 and very comfortable too
"nike I've worn plenty of sneakers in my years, from the old Converse Stars to top flight running shoes. This is the second pair of Monarch IV's that I've owned and the only shoes that fit and feel comfortable. I would recommend them to anyone with foot trouble from arthritis (which is my problem) to achy tired and sore feet. These feel like heaven! Buy yourselves a pair."
nike My second pair...great sturdy shoes
"nike Good Looking, Comfortable Shoe... But Don't Let It Get In Contact With ANY Moisture/Water...<br/>THESE SHOES STINK !!! HORRIBLY... After getting wet..."
nike Great Shoe !!!
nike Very pleased
nike I got these shoes because I owned a couple pairs of the white monarch air and simple loved them but my work changed the appearence code to black I've tried different brands but nothing stands against Nike Air I wear them from about 9:05pm to 9:30am right before I leave for work to when I get home.
"nike This pair replaced a former pair. that was over 2 yrs old. Wear for work....fits good, and great for working on concrete hard floors."
nike great sneaker
nike THE BEST CLASSIC SNEAKERS FROM NIKE.
"nike The only shoes I buy, I bought a pair two years ago and they finally fell apart on me. I am 6'30 320lbs finding a high quality comfortable shoe that can stand up to my abuse for two years at a great price is amazing."
"nike My second pair, that should say something about the shoe. Great fit and comfort."
"nike Perfect Fit, arrived on time, saved what would have been a LOUSEY vacation due to my shoe coming apart on the first day of the trip."
"nike If you need shoes to fit over AFO's these are the ones for you! Order the 4E width and then you can measure the actual size of the brace and not have to go super long in the toe. My son wears these EVERY day, and they are holding up WONDERFULLY! I will defenatly be purchasing another pair."
nike The sneaker looks really nice the colors are a perfect blend and the sneakers  are very comfortable. It is wide to give my foot room and I made a great choice .
nike great shoes ..thats my second pair
nike Just exactly as I expected.  You cannot go wrong with this maker.
nike They are very comfortable. The only criticism is that they make noise which increases as they get older. Design flaw?
"nike My job requires me to be on my feet all day, hauling kegs and cases of beer, so good shoes are pretty important. Bought my first pair from a brick and mortar store. They worked great and held up longer than my previous pair of work shoes. Finally worked em to death and needed a new pair. The store didn't have the size I needed so I got the new ones from here. Two shifts in and I'm glad I bought a second pair."
nike The arch is way to big and I have flat feet. Will be returning them to a local store near me for full refund. Would have kept them and rated it five stars if it wasn't for the arch.
"nike Always loved these shoes for comfort and support, but had only seen the rather dated looking white with blue.  Now with the improved color selections, Nike has hit it out of the park with these,"
nike I like the shoes but after wearing them for a number of days one shoe developed an annoying clicking sound when I walk.  I hate it when athletic type shoes do this!  I guess something has broken in the sole?
nike perfect
nike perfect
"nike Seriously Nike, you still can't fix the squeak issue that plagues the Monarch series of shoes for several years? Spend the extra 2 cents per dozen and upgrade the bottom of the shoe."
"nike It is look like a huge , regardless whether it is comfortable or not ...."
nike Comfortable good work shoes. After reading the reviews stating these run small I usually wear a 10.5 so I ordered an 11 and they fit perfect. Haven't experienced any squeak yet but I might just powder these bad boys up to avoid it.
nike I like the shoe. What else can I say.
"nike Arch support is below average.  Find an insole that works for you.  I did, and I can wear these things all day: walking, being a tourist, or standing on concrete all day (I work in a TV studio)."
"nike This is the fourth pair of these that I have purchased.  I use an older pair for yard work, and the others are still wearable, So, they have held up really well.  When it came time for a new pair, it was not ""what"" shoe I was going to buy, but I needed to find out if they were still available."
nike very solid well built shoe
nike great  shoes fast shipping
nike Absolutely love this shoe! Perfect in everyway..
nike i walk a lot covering a large hosp all night. these shoes are the most comfortable shoes ive found
"nike My husband has high arches and is hard to fit.  These are the only athletic shoes he wears, and he loves them.  They look great, hold up very well, and fit true to size."
"nike Still have my old pair, too.  The medium width of these shoes is just a slight bit wider than my other shoes of similar type (e.g. Sketchers), which I really appreciate."
"nike Bought it for my husband and he loved it. He has a wide feet, I ordered 4E and fits perfet ü§£ü§£ I'll order again"
nike Worn this style for years
nike I wear them for both day-to-day casual wear and fitness. No complaints.
"nike Great fight, but price is what made these perfect! Will purchase again!"
nike I bought these shoes for my father! He loves them so much! However for other shoe buyers: Always get a half a size to a full size bigger. My father is a size 11 and I ended up getting him a size 12 in this shoe!
"nike Still holding up great after a couple of months. I wear these at the gym and for factory work... approximately 50 hours a week. Very durable. Excellent craftsmanship.  I thought I heard the infamous squeak, but it went away. I use insoles for added support and comfort."
nike These were a bit stiff out of the box compared to my newbalance but broke in after a few days. Luckily I ordered a half size bigger than what I usually get or they would have been to small. I am happy with my purchase
nike My son has a very wide foot &amp; we have a tough time finding shoes that fit. This is our 2nd pair.
nike This is the only shoe my husband wears.  They came a day early.  Great
nike Feel comfortable walk.
nike Product details said it is 4E wide but it turned out to be 2E wide
"nike I'm using it for tennis, mostly FL clay courts and it's great so far.  Very comfortable with good traction."
nike Had these in the past and is my 3rd pair. I like them and they're a great shoe for the money.
nike good comfortable shoes
nike Shoes are tight so order a wide in place of a regular fit.
nike Very nice shoes lots of white
nike returned fit way smaller than your normal size plus they make u pay to return them as well. Not nice $25 to return product. buyer beware.
nike Great shoes.  I've owned several pairs over the years.  They still have the squeak problem.  You have to remove the inserts.  They're glued in.  Be gentile.  Add a shot of baby powder and put the inserts back in.  Totally worth the effort.  Most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.
nike Good shoes. Very happy
nike Awesome!
nike This is my 4th pair of the Nike Air Monarch IV. I wear size 14 D an am happy that Nike hasn't changed anything since my first pair. very comfortable and durable.
"nike I had given up on wearing comfortable walking shoes, but these Nike Air Monarchs are comfortable and fit great with my 4E size foot. I also have a high arch, so each pair gets a Sole custom foot bed (sold separately). I wear these to work and around the house for a year almost every day then it's time for a new pair. This is my third pair."
"nike Arrived on time. Fit pretty good, maybe a touch wide. I'm happy."
nike Good fit - good shoe - but like most medium priced shoes the inserts are cheap - need more padding on the insole - I had to add new insole to get a great feel - nice
"nike Am a big fan of Nike! and as always Nike exceeded the expectations.... should go for it.... though i read some comments before i got this shoes that's squeaky.... but i haven't heard anything so far, also it's very light shoe and perfect for running or even while am training at the Gym."
nike I love it so much
nike Great shoe fits real good  And very comfortable would buy again
"nike It's always a great, easy and fast alternative purchasing with Amazon!!! I'll keep being a good client of it!!!! Fair prices most of the times!!!"
nike Love them so far! Very comfortable! Haven't heard any squeaking yet like some of the other people on here. I got them for work inside a warehouse and have to have black leather shoes and these are definitely the most comfortable I've tried. Not the best looking shoe I've had but who cares there for my work lol! Highly recommend!
nike All of Nikes best shoes !!!
"nike I have a wide foot and they fit well.  I use it for working out, yard work and errands.  I would not run in this shoe but on a stair master or bike no problem."
"nike Purchased these for my giant 17yr old son and though it is difficult to know at mens size 15, (everything has to be ordered on line) Nike shoes seem to never let us down. Packaging and shipping was excellent and it is a good fit,"
nike Great product and shipping
nike These sneakers fit great &amp; are very comfortable but they have an annoying squeak!  It started after a few weeks of wear!
"nike I have to say these are my preferred shoes to wear to work.  I do a lot of walking in my shift and we are required to have all black shoes.  These never let me down.  Keep my feet comfortable and look great.  One bad thing is the squeak you get after walking in them a while.  There is a simple fix to this, however.  Just lift the insole out and put some baby powder in the bottom.  Let it coat everything and replace the insole."
nike Ordered half size larger and feel really good. Ordered larger because of toe nail problems. Quality appears to be Nike standards.
"nike Well constructed and comfortable.  Just have to correct the Nike ""squeak"" by placing some baby powder underneath liner..."
nike I was having some sore feet issues. Ordered these in the wide size and they feel great!!
"nike Also better than ""Skechers""."
"nike I posted that these pair of Air Monarch's were somewhat large, however that was only on my right foot.  None of us have exact sizes of both feet and I have always known that one was a 1/2 in shorter than the other.  I will get years of wear out of these and the right shoe will be adjusted to not feel to big."
"nike I've owned pretty much all brands of athletic shoes at one time or another.  These are unquestionably the lightest and most comfortable athletic shoes I've ever owned. When they wear out, I'll buy them again."
nike Husband loves Nike just hard to find wide shoes
"nike I've bought this style before from a brick and mortar a couple years ago and loved them.  These are no different.  They fit well,  and so far have made no noise, squeaks, groans or otherwise. I was able to get them for the same price as the store,  and with free shipping,  that more than made up for the gas I would have spent getting to a decent shoe store."
nike Shoes didn't last long.
nike Really surprised Nike came out with a wide width shoe. That reason kept me out of Nike for years.
nike Hard to find these in black these days so I felt lucky to find these in black and in the size I wanted. My husband wears them for work and has been wearing them for years. Great price for the comfort. He's a pretty big guy with high arches.
"nike Front of shoes  notches, push up to bottom of foot. I wear all the time, only get 6 weeks out off a pair of shoes because the bottom of the shoe notches push up and it!s like walking on rocks.  POOR DESIGN,"
"nike I have really wide feet.  These fit perfectly.<br/><br/>However... I have ordered several pairs, and THEY ALL SQUEAK, and I mean really loud.  You do not even have to walk on them, but just squeeze the soles and the heal area, and the sound like a rubber ducky in heat.<br/><br/>But.... They are comfortable and the serve me well."
"nike My husband bought a pair of these several years ago and he is hard on shoes. Six months would be a long time for him to wear them out. We have stuck with these and they are a great shoe or my husband wouldn't keep buying them. They last, they are comfortable, and for a picky man like he is they are a great shoe. Just try them. You won't be disappointed."
nike These shoes are my favorites....they are well made and obviously very nice looking....I bought a pair for myself and my dad and he loves them as well....Had to buy him another pair to wear to church only...  Cant go wrong with these....
"nike Nike makes a great shoe.<br/><br/>The sizing remains constant across the years with Nike, they fit everytime.<br/><br/>What a comfortable walking shoe. Every stride has a soft landing with good support offering a stable platform. The sole has good traction even in sub-freezing weather (Can't say they are very warm).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this shoe for people who enjoy walking."
"nike Bought with the intention of using as running shoes...i wear size nine and expected this to fit just right, however i developed tender toes after my first workout(6km). Great shoe though."
nike nice gift
"nike Very comfortable, also they look nice and are good quality, this is the second pair I've owned."
nike I have a white pair of the same shoe in the same size that fits perfectly. This pair is smaller. Maybe if they were made here in the USA instead of China the quality control would be better.
nike Great shoes! They dont even cause blisters!
nike Thank you
nike Shoes are just right . Use for work on my feet all day long . Love them .
nike This is such a comfortable walking shoe that I ordered a second pair before I needed another.
nike Shoes are stiff lack flexibility. Laces are to hard to pull through eyes. Feels like a robot when walking.<br/>Running forget it. Only good thing is price $59.00.
"nike Fits comfortably, made just right for anyone that has a extra wide foot like me"
"nike love these, I have worn these for about 20years. I buy the exact same model as soon as one wears out."
nike These are my husbands favorite sneakers. Very hard to find his size at Kohl's. Price might be a little more but worth the convenience.
"nike Great quality shoes, wear all day!  No squeaking to date, although baby powder usually will handle that based on the previous reviews I‚Äôve read.  Glad I got them, very comfortable, would buy again!"
"nike My kids call these ""dad"" sneakers. I call them awesome, they fit well , stylish (for me) and very comfortable. My toes are not compressed and have room ."
nike The most comfortable pair of shoes I've owned.  I'm on my third pair.  The first pair I owned start to make noise when I walked but I put some foot powder in them and the noise went away.
"nike I've been buying this same shoe (and its previous versions) for fifteen years or more. My size 15 foot says ""With that good of a fit, why would you quit?"""
nike Great court shoes. Rugged and comfortable. I like the new colors as well.  The availability of 4E widths is a big plus for me.  I play 3 to 4 tennis matches a week and these shoes have held up well.
nike Perfect fit for my bunions
nike Great shoe! Comfortable shoes and looks very nice!
"nike After buying this for my husband, he wore it for several months and then it started making squeaky noises everytime he would walk in them.<br/>The sneakers are really nice and comfortable but too noisy."
nike This is my third pair of these shoes.
nike Better than expected! Fit perfect. Great Quality.
"nike Typical well fitting Nike shoes. Comfortable without bizarre  colors. They do squeak more than I remembered, but I added powder and it is better."
nike Not getting 5 stars until is I see how durable they are. I got these to wear when working in the yard. The shoes were immediately comfortable out of the box. No break in period was required.
nike Inferior padding compared to what they used to have.  I have worn Air Monarch for years still better than some but not as good as they used to be
"nike Bought a pair of Air Monarch;s about four years ago. Although it's been tweaked a bit it's basically the same shoe and I applaud Nike for not giving the shoe a makeover just for the sake of change. It's a winner. It is extremely comfortable due to the full length air sole and gives great support for basketball, tennis or just plain walking. BONUS: If you're looking to add to your overall height this shoe will add another inch."
nike MY SHOES CAME IN BLACK. SUPPOSED TO BE WHITE AND BLUE. I'LL KEEP THEM BUT NOT HAPPY.IF I GET MORE PROBLEMS LIKE THIS I'LL HAVETO SHOP AT STORES.
"nike My husband is a little league umpire. He loves the fit, the look, and the comfort level"
nike These are my fifth  pair since 2009. I use them mostly for walking exercise. I wear a 14 D. They are very comfortable right out of the box.
"nike Have several pairs. The best shoe for the money, I have Brooks &amp; NB at $150 a pair that aren't anywhere near as good for wear and support. Colrs can be hard to find."
nike Unbelievably squeakyIf i could return them i  would.I wear work shoes most of the time.. i put them on  and they  squeak  badly .
nike Very nice. Good choice!
"nike Great shoes, love them."
nike Have had these shoes before. Very comfortable to me. Last well. Look nice. Good value in my opinion.
nike Very good well made shoe with lots of support and cushion.  This is the shoe if you want all day comfort and I own 10 pairs of tennis shoes at this time.  These are my favorite.
"nike Long time air wearer, best walk around shoe I have ever found.  I miss the original Nike style air shoes, but have found these to be just fine. I get long time use from my Nike's, so I cannot comment on that yet but so far they are holding up well.<br/>Note to Nike bring us back the original air shoe at a reasonable price and they will sell!"
nike Comfortable
nike They are great.  Fit like I expected and are super soft.  Very comfortable.
"nike Yes, they are a decent pair of shoes. My biggest complaint is that for the price, the quality is a bit lacking. Long-term durability is yet to be seen, but they lack the feel of a well-made shoe that I have come to expect from Nike. Back in the day, you could still get a quality shoe from Nike without going into the triple-digit price range. These are not the least-expensive pair of Nikes that I could have bought, but they ""feel"" like they are.<br/><br/>I am not referring to the fact that they are light weight, which is a plus, but more to the overall appearance and feel. The soles feel very ""plastic-y"", and make more noise than what I am used to, or care for. The rest of the shoe just feels synthetic and cheaply made. If this is what passes for a reasonably priced pair of Nikes today, then I am pretty disappointed. If it is just this model, then I feel a bit deceived.<br/><br/>On the plus side, they are reasonably comfortable, and have a good bit of cushion at the bottom of the foot (insole?), hence the third star. The lessons I learned from this purchase are these: Don't always stick to one brand because you have known them to be reliable in the past, and perhaps more importantly, maybe shoes are just something you shouldn't buy online unless you have seen them and tried them on in person beforehand."
nike great shoe very nice..
"nike Good shoes.  But they didn't last very long.<br/><br/>My shoes usually last about a year and a half.  I wore through the soles in these in about 9 months.  Aside from that, they were great shoes."
nike One thing about Nike is their sizes are always really close.  Very comfortable shoes.  Bought a cheapy pair of shoes in between last Nikes and latest Nikes and it is true that you get what you pay for at least when dealing with Nike.
"nike The Nike Air monarchs are an excellent shoes. They fit me better than a glove as they say love the way they feel I am a hard person to buy shoes for, thank you, J. Mutch"
"nike This has been my new ""all-around"" shoe (work, gym, wherever) for a while now, since newbalance turned my beloved 623's to junk. Perfect fit, nice style, not too flashy. Great anywhere sneakers are acceptable."
"nike So far so good. Haven't put many miles on them yet, but they feel very solid with good support."
nike nice shoes great fit
"nike These are my 6th pair of the exact same shoe. I would wear them for work if I was not required to dress as a Professional. Kindest regards, Rick Swentek, Key Largo."
nike great shoe for walking. My feet feel great.
nike My job requires all black shoes and since I'm on my feet most of the time they need to be comfy.<br/>Glad I found these. Comfy and affordable.<br/>I ordered half a sz up and fit great.
nike I've had these shoes for just over a month and only worn them maybe ten times. The sole is already starting to peel near the toe and its past the time that they will take returns. Definitely wouldn't recommend.
nike Shoe is in excellent condition and are a great value. I normally wear a 9.5 which is what I ordered but the fit a little tight so maybe order a wider size. Not too tight so they may break in.
nike Good Sneakers. Love them
nike Love these shoes. I'm on my feet all day on concrete and I'm a pretty heavy guy. My feet feel great. Lots of roe room. I will buy these again.<br/>And I did
"nike Okay shoe, it fits as sized and provides good comfort."
nike The shoes are a little narrow in fit. But I figure this will take care of it self with wear. I love the look and sturdiness of these sneakers
nike I have been  wearing these shoes for years.  I have a wide foot and a narrow heel. I hate shoe shopping. Nike adds  2 lace  holes at the top so I can tighten the shoe around my ankles.
"nike This product met all of my expectations, and even surpassed them. The item epitomizes the meaning of true quality, and I would definitely do business again!"
nike I have been buying and wearing these shoes for years and I love em.
nike My dad and I both love these shoes .I had to get him a pair for fathers day. I have owned them forever. As soon as I get them I can wear them. No break in period for these shoes.
"nike My husband really likes these shoes.  I like the way they look too.  We are pleased.  My hubby has a wide foot and these are a little narrow for him, but they are still comfortable.  If you feet are more than borderline wide, I would order a wide width."
nike These shoes were great for a couple of months of daily wear but by three months there was no more air in these Nike Airs
"nike Great cushion and support. Second pair I've bought for my father. Yes, they do squeak, but that was expected and not an issue for him."
"nike I've been wearing Nike Monarchs for years. They look good, fit well and I like the reflective patches and the finger loops for pulling them on. I'll keep buying them."
"nike My husband has been wearing this style shoe for several years.  He gets good fit, happy feet and comfort for the day with these.  They hold up well so they also last a long time.  He was happy to recently discover they came in black too."
nike Too narrow.  Cost too much to return.
nike Comfortable shoes.for all day walking
nike BOUGHT A PAIR 11 YEARS AGO AND THEY STILL ARE OK FOR ROUGH WORK. NEW PAIR LOOK LIKE DRESS SHOES BY COMPAIRSON. LOOK FOR TO 11 MORE YEARS WITH THESE WHICH WILL TAKE ME TO 94 YEARS !!!
nike EXCELLENT BUY
"nike No problems with delivery and I got the size and color I asked for. No complaints here. Cool shoe too, I got them for gym training."
nike It's a great shoe for the gym - just about a half size small.
nike I have bought this same shoe for years so I already know they fit me well. They are comfortable and last a long time. So it's all about price and delivery which are both superior on Amazon.Com. I love em! (The shoes that is.)
nike Great shoe!
nike My son will only wear these tennis shoes. They are comfortable for him to wear all day at school and when he works after school/weekends. They last about a year and then we replace them with the same shoe because he won't even try on anything else.
"nike Absolutely zero complaints with this shoe.  I've had many pairs of the Nike Monarch through the years as they are the most comfortable multi sports shoe I've found.  My main use now, as I get up in the years is for walking, 3-6 miles a day.  I'll continue to purchase these as long as NIKE makes them.  Highly recommend these to anyone that wants to pamper their feet."
nike This is my sixth pair of this shoe. I love them
nike This is my #six pair. Great shoes.
nike My foot grew last year from a D to an E width. I was really surprised when the Nike 15 4E was too narrow. The support was very good and comfortable. Sad they were too narrow.
"nike Too much heel for my taste, as u may be able to see from the rear view. However, I bought them for my husband and he loves them, which is what is important!! They seem to fit good and are even comfy. Overall great value at a good price."
nike Shoes do not fit.  Would like to return the shoes.  Not sure what process I need to go through to return the shoes.
"nike My husband is difficult to fit. He has wide and very thick feet. These shoes fit great, support him well and aids his walking. Just wish they came in black in his size."
nike a gift that was well received.  my husband will only wear this shoe in this style and plays tennis in them weekly on hard courts.
"nike Great training shoes, good fit , comfortable!!"
"nike Super nice shoes; very light and comfortable; quiet for me although others have reported they ""squeak""; NIKE - can't go wrong; appear to be durable"
nike Awesome!
nike Liked it
"nike RE purchase, I have had these before"
nike Little to small hoping they will loosen up..
"nike I was eligible for free shipping.<br/>By the time it came to buy them, I could not get the option to work and paid Over $20 for the shipping."
nike these shoes are very wide at the front of the foot.  Will not buy shoes from amazon because don't know what products look like
nike My husband loves these shoes. He still wears them almost everyday and they look great even after being washed a dozen times. He says they're the most comfortable shoes he's ever worn.
nike Great value!
nike One shoe larger than the other
"nike Good shoe. Had them for almost 7 months now, and with a little upkeep, they look almost new. Even after heavy gym use. Definitely satisfied, and would recommend them."
"nike I take a 3E, Thought 4E would be too wide. Perfect fit."
"nike Excellent, Light but Quality."
"nike A great buy, I have several styles of Monarch IV"
nike They fit great!!
nike comfortable shoe
nike The shoes was as advertised...they fit good and felt comfortable.
nike Wear these as a postal carrier and its made walking 10 miles alot more tolerable.
"nike The title was misleading , i thought i was ordering 4e ... no matter what size i choose, but i had to choose 4e which i fail to notice!"
nike Great work shoes.
"nike Constantly looking for comfortable and affordable extra wide shoes, unfortunately the rubber sole became separated from shoe within a month. Had to return."
nike awesome shoes.perfect fit.it's my 3rd pair of monarch
"nike I don't actually run in these. I wear them for everyday use when I'm not at work. I have really wide feet. It's hard to find a decent pair of (non-ugly) athletic shoes in extra-wide. I've had 2 pair of the Air Alvord style over the years and loved them. One pair finally wore out (the newer of the two actually). The other pair has been relegated to lawn mowing use. This is appears to be the contemporary equivalent. I've been wearing Dan Post western boots and a pair of Converse Chuck II off duty. I wear Timberland Pro's for the other 40+ hours a week that I'm at work. Consequently, my feet are killing me. I broke down &amp; got the $40 insole upgrade for the Timberlands (HUGE IMPROVEMENT!) and a pair of these. After three days I have way less pain over all. These are great shoes for people like myself who've been blessed with ""flintstone feet""."
nike Fit and was New in package.
nike 08/14/2015<br/>Bought this for a friend and he is very happy with them because he had the same shoe for several years and finally wanted a new pair just like the ones he had.  He is very happy and find them just as they should be.<br/>wjc
nike I expected this to be a wide shoe for my husband but it was much wider than expected. With a thicker sock it works for him. It's a great pair of shoes for the price with good support. He is on his feet a lot so support and comfort is a major concern.
"nike I love these shoes. Great price, Nike Air for less then $100. I like them so much that I bought a 2nd pair for Pickleball."
"nike These are the greatest shoes ever.  I use them for working out, mountain biking, drinking partying.  Extremely comfortable"
nike I have a really hard time finding shoes that fit and are comfortable.  These were great right out of the box.  Very happy.
nike My husband will wear nothing but these shoes.  He's had two knee replacements and is quite active for being 75 years old.  The Nike Air gives him the support and comfort he needs with being on his feet six to eight  hours a day.
nike Excellent for a large man.
"nike I have high arches and normally need to replace the stock insole with something more supportive. Same with these. Other than that, no complaints!"
nike Never been very fond of Nike because so narrow...the 4E size has given me the width needed and am very happy after 1 week
nike I have had two pairs of these and really like them for their support inside and outside of the shoe.  This time I ordered two more pair since they were on sale.
"nike Unable to give an honest response because the item  was  not for me.This item was bought for someone else.  So far, I have not heard any complains about the item."
nike These are really nice shoes and they are very comfortable. Have been wearing them every day for about six months and are holding up very nicely.
nike Really good shoe. Needs some more break-in time but so far so good.
"nike these shoes run a little small, buy 1/2 size larger and they will fit perfect."
nike I like these shoes ...the only drawback is they usually start squeaking after about 3 or 4 months ...but they are comfortable for me .
nike Great shoe for the money.
nike Everything as advertised.
nike Never bought a set of Nikes before because they were always too narrow now they offering in the wide width I'll buy more
nike The shoe's feel great ! Love them !!
nike Great value
nike These shoes fit perfectly!  Really comfortable and I can wear these for a few hours while working out - running/jogging.  They also look really good as well.
nike great shoes for all types of activity!
"nike Great shoe, fits perfect, looks great, easy purchase process!!"
"nike Overall I liked the shoes.  They hold up well, but they do run just a tad small.  I'd say order the next half size up of what you might normally get.  Normally I buy Reebok, however this time around I bough Nike.  Maybe if youre a Nike fan you already know exactly what size to get, but if you're not, a half size up is the way to go."
"nike Shoes fit better than expected. Like, ""I want sleep in these shoes!"" Feet finally feel comfort."
"nike No issues at all, shipped fast and packaged well. Would recommend this product."
nike Most comfortable tennis shoe ever made!
nike Very much as expected
nike They feel great look good and what else do you want from a pair of shoes?
nike RETURNED
"nike Had these in the past, this my second pair,  I don't use these for any serious cardio training or exercise, but very comfortable for casual walking and everyday wear at a reasonable price."
nike Excellent pair of everyday shoes for the price.  I don't exercise in them--have other shoes for that--but there's no reason I couldn't.  I wore a pair of last-generation Nikes very similar to these every day for three years.  Great shoe.
nike I needed an all leather shoe for my trips in the fall and winter. Bought this because I have had great experiences with similar shoes - which needed replacing.
"nike These are the only shoes that my 83 year old Dad can wear due to his feet, knees and back. He''s on his second pair already this year."
nike nice shoe  fits well
"nike My hubby is hard on his shoes, they never seem to last more than a couple of months, these seem to be a little better than most in the same price range."
nike Got here in decent time frame shoes fit as well as the pair I bought previously in a store but these were cheaper price for exact same shoe!  Love them! Comfortable and stylish!
nike all good -
nike This is  my 3rd pair. great shoes. I have a really wide foot and fit excellent.
nike i've only worn them once but they fit snug and were comfortable walking around in all day. seller delivered as promised
"nike I really like these shoes, fit is perfect sizing and the feel great, very comfortable and look nicer.  Considering the quality this is an excellent value."
nike thanks
nike They are the best cross training shoes out there under $100. They fit great and are comfortable to wear all day. The only draw back is you get the traditional Monarch squeak when you walk about 3 months later. I can live with that.
"nike These shoes I like very much, for a low end Nike Air shoes they fit the bill for a comfy walking shoes, has very good grip in wet situation...And Just enough Air support to take edge off walking on concrete. Was delivered ontime, and packed in a smaller sized box and over all satisifed with order...Would buy again. Thanks<br/>Todd Poole"
"nike Nice shoes but a little tight in width where others in regular fit fine.  Wore outsid for the day, so can't return."
nike I have been wearing the white ones for years...needed black for work..
"nike good shoe, good value, ordered wrong size at first and Amazon took care of everything and got me a new pair in a couple of days.  Not always easy to find this shoe in a wide size.  Very happy with this purchase."
nike To tight. I dont see a wide option as my foot is wide. That was the reason of my order return
nike Excellent sneaker
nike Love these shoes!
nike Product as expected. Shipping much faster than expected.
"nike All good. Shoes were just what I ordered, right size, and color, a right and left shoe, and fit was as expected."
"nike My 4th pair of these, very comfortable. Only complaint is that the laces stretch over time and need replacement."
nike Great shoes..thanks!
nike Made mistake my order not 4 E
nike I have very wide feet. These are just about perfect. The arch support is minimal so I added those from my previous shoes. These are great cross-training shoes.
"nike Once you google how to fix the squeak, these shoes are the fantastic~"
"nike I've had this shoe, in this size, in the past.  BUT! getting this size locally was nearly impossible. Got what I needed with no hassle and they feel perfect."
nike Nike still makes a very high quality shoe. It offers excellent support and durability. This my second pair of this modal.
"nike I've seen a lot of reviews on these shoes, and a lot of complaints about the squeakiness of them, but they have yet to start squeaking on me after a week or so of wearing them. They fit, feel and look great, I would buy them again."
"nike they look sharp at the beginning, but squeak with every step. last average 3-4 months with daily wear. this is my 4th pair and the only reason I keep buying them is I cant find anything better in my price range."
nike Too squeeky....very annoying
"nike I have been purchasing this particular model for years now. These are the best, they last a long time and fit and support is perfect for me. I hope they never discontinue them."
nike Can't comment on arch support.  I've got flat feet.  Comfortable though. I have trouble finding sneakers I like so when I do get a few pairs and stick 'em in the closet for next year or so.
"nike felt good when first put on ,but when I walked with them I got sore on little toe"
nike first shoe ive every bought that i wanted to get a second pair of. very good quality and comfy!
nike excellent buy!
nike Perfect :)
"nike Very comfortable! I have one leg and on my prosthetic foot, great spring back. Great walking shoe all around!"
"nike My husband loves these, has the same pair already but they are worn out,  Bought as a Christmas gift for him."
nike These shoes are exactly what I expected. They are so light and comfortable. Men's shoes always fit better for me.
nike Bought these for the hubby to replace the ones he wore out. He says they're the best he's found for his use.
"nike THE BLACK SHOE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET.<br/><br/>It says Metallic Silver/Mid Navy...and that is what I wanted and what I got.<br/><br/>These are great all purpose running, walking training shoes.  That is why they keep making this model shoe.<br/><br/>Simple and durable.  Mine last about 1 1/2 years each with HEAVY use."
"nike These are a great tennis shoe, comfortable and long lasting. I have been wearing this brand and style of tennis shoe for the last ten plus years. The only down side is when they are wet they are squeaky. Hopefully, the sole looks a little different on these, maybe they have that fixed. ."
nike I am wearing this shoe daily for 10 hours till now I did not feel any pain. This is one of the most awesome cousin shoe. I search in the net for couple of days to buy a cheap and best shoe and finally I found this.
nike Fit like a glove. Look and feel great
nike Fit as expected and was delivered in 2 days. We are happy happy.
"nike Comfortable. As pictured. True to size.  He had a different style of Nike previously, so we just ordered the same size in this style. So it seems nike sizes are consistent."
nike very comfy shoes. fit was right on the spot at 8.5
"nike Bought these for my husband's birthday, and he loves them! Not easy to find size 13 shoes in the stores for him, especially in a style that he likes. Received in expected timeframe, and price was excellent. Thanks!!"
"nike I wish they were a little less ""white""‚Ä¶ But other than that great fit great and feel great purchase"
nike Excellent buy on a classic pair of Nike Monarchs.  One of the best walking shoes on the market. They fit excellent and the service as well as shipping was first rate. The Monarchs are a great fit if you have wide feet and do allot of walking.  They are light as well as comfortable with the quality you would expect from Nike.
nike they're alright. I got them for daily use but they're a bit snug so i've been using them as semi-dress shoes
"nike One of the most comfortable shoes I've had (this is my second pair). They are not the best looking shoe on the market, but for me it's all about comfort!"
nike Excellent.
"nike Have used this sneaker for years, I work on a cement floor 9 hours a day, and these have been the most comfortable shoe or sneaker I've found."
"nike This is my third pair of Nike Air Monarchs.  I normally wouldn't buy shoes online, but having previously had two pairs, I knew what to expect.  It's a shoe that works well for me, and I'll probably buy them as long as Nike makes them."
"nike It's classified as a running shoe, but I play tennis in these and they are a great and comfortable shoe on the court."
"nike Fits perfect , Ive got one leg and these are the best for me I've tried a lot and Nike Air are the best."
nike Nice shoe
nike Nike cross trainer style shoe. Fits true to size. A great Nike product. Shipped and received fast. Would recommend and would order again.
"nike They are cheaper at Dick's if you have one close. Good shoe overall, like the wider fit. Sometimes you have to re-glue the little tab in the front."
"nike After reading reviews and seeing that shoe ran small I ordered up 1/2 size and they were too big, I needed the size I always wear so I don't know why the reviews said  they ran small.  The company didn't do exchanges for some reason so I returned them and ordered from Dicks Sporting Goods (no shipping charge and they do exchanges)"
nike Love these shoes. This might be the seventh pair I've purchased over the years. Always have at least one pair and usually two.
nike Great shoe for work!
nike looking to buy a wider pair but do not understand the new sizing chart.
"nike <a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Nike-Men-s-Air-Monarch-IV-Running-Shoe-Metallic-Silver-Mid-Navy-8/dp/B004IM5K1K"">Nike Men's Air Monarch IV Running Shoe Metallic Silver/Mid Navy (8)</a>¬†A great casual wear for an evening out with the guys.  Fit is excellent and material looks quite durable."
nike They seem narrow probably should have gotten the extra wide
nike Delivered fast.  Just what I wanted and they fit perfectly.
"nike A good all black Nike shoe that you can wear.  There is some white lettering on the tongue of the shoe, but my pants cover it, so work doesn't care."
"nike Heard complaints about the squeaking before I ordered, but have worn these shoes before and really find them very comfortable.  Will get the baby powder soon and fix the squeaks!"
nike Nicee
nike Great for running or walking and standing on your feet for long periods of time... they really provide lots of comfort
nike Very good product
nike My husband loves these shoes. He stays on his feet all day at work and he says they are comfortable
nike Okay the shoe seems a little bit bulky in terms of the padding at the ankle bought this for my son however he says its very comfortable.
nike This shoe is what I expected. The only complaint is that there is little to no arch in the shoe. I'll end up working around that with an insert.
nike Only Nike's I will buy.
nike Nothing special here but a good pair of comfy sneakers . Wear well and no break in time good out of the box . Good value
nike Great that the third pair same size and shape and style.
nike Shipped perfect. Fit perfect.
nike I returned these and ordered a smaller size. The exchange was easy and the new ones fit perfectly.
nike These shoes were much to wide ... Makes for good front to back support but not good lateral support ... If you have wide feet you will be fine ... But to wide for me!
"nike These are very nice looking sneakers. My husband is very pleased with them, says they fit well and are really comfortable. We haven't had a problem with them squeaking like some of the reviews say so maybe Nike has taken care of that problem. If not, I am prepared to put the powder under the sole!"
"nike I've owned a pair of these for about a year and a half so I knew the size would be right,and  they would be long term wearable.  Overall a decent value for a sneaker."
nike What I did was order them a 1/2 size bigger because I know they run a little small very nice shoe
nike bought another pair locally and had to get a 10 rather than my normal 9 1/2 gave others to father in law. other than size issue good shoes
nike The shoe was okay. The only issue I had was the shoe felt like you are putting your leg in a cushioned ditch. It was way different than other nike shoes I owned.
"nike Bought the same shoes before, not through Amazon. They're exactly the product I wanted. Feel great and a good fit"
nike Fits perfect just what you expect from Nike just make sure to get the length and width right before you order
nike I buy the same monarchs year after year and love them!
nike Sneakers look great on my son and shipped as expected.
nike just fit right
nike Nikes are always a little on the snug side but that's why I like them and they are comfortable. Definitely adds a spring to my step.
"nike I have a wide foot and it fits great for that, I usually wear a 9 1/2 and with this I have to get a size 10. This is the second pair, I had the first for about 2 years."
nike Good summertime work shoe
nike Shoes that my husband wears all of the time- he adds a Dr Scholl's insert and he is able to work 10 hours on his feed with decreased knee pain.
nike Just like my two year old whites which I enjoy daily.
nike Comfortable and a good fit
nike Still breaking them in but seem well put together and fit as expected. So far they are perfect.
"nike These shoes fit well, nice and wide profile.  Husband has a bunion and these work well for him."
"nike fit just right, still comfortable after a long walk with the dog.  I would buy the shoes again."
nike My husband love it!!! He said it's very comfortable. I have not heard it squeak yet lol and i asked him if it squeaks at all he said no! I'm glad I got this one.
nike A great shoe
nike One of the few shoes available in a true 4E. My son has very wide feet and these did the trick
nike This was a gift for my brother he liked the shoes. Fast shipping. Everything worked out great!
nike Bought as a gift and they were perfect
nike 10-year old grandson wore these shoes maybe three weeks before they fell apart.
nike But working in a noisy environment I'm the only one who will know. I'll try the powder trick.
nike First Sneaker ever with width (4E) as advertised. Fits perfectly. Going to buy another pair!!
"nike I've been wearing Air Monarchs for years.  They are great shoes!  I usually have purchase them at a local sporting goods store but they were out of size 11 so thought I try Amazon.  Unfortunately, They are SMALLER than the size 11 Air Monarchs that I've been wearing.  I'm going to try to return them if I can.  Very Disappointed"
nike This is a 10.5 M as opposed to the 10.5 W I've had before. Seems to be another perfect size though. Couldn't be happier with the typical Nike cushy comfort.
nike Love these sneakers. Very comfortable....have ordered 2 more pairs in different colors since my first purchase.
nike good shoes
nike Nikes tend to run narrow so these 4Es fit my slighty wide foot perfectly.  Very comfortable.
nike Tight around the toe area.
nike These shoes are very comfortable and have great arch support which is very important to me. Highly recommended.
nike always a good fit
nike have not heard the squeaking yet but when they get old and i do mean old like falling apart then you hear the squeaking. Other than that just a great shoe. my 3 pair if not 4th.
"nike My husband has worn these shoes for a few years, they are always comfortable from the first time he puts them on."
nike The left tennis shoes was small. Look like size 8.<br/>The right foot is perfect 8.5 size.
"nike Very happy, fits true to size. Very comfty. Do walking for exercise, exactly what I needed."
nike These are my go-to shoes for comfort and support. The best I've found in years. This was replacement for a worn out pair.
"nike Very Comfortable. I was hesitant to buy online, but was pleasantly surprised. Like the wider options online you cant find in stores too!"
"nike I cannot disparage this shoe. It simply wasn't enough better than my 4 year old newbalance to replace them. Also, and this is simply my own consideration, the front is so built up, the toe cap, that it won't fit easily into the rubber stirrups on the exercise machines at my club. I wasn't even wearing them at the time. I simply had taken one shoe out of the box and gone over to several machines. Sounds petty but I didn't want to struggle getting my feet into the stirrups on the machines. My old NB have a much lower front and they slip right in. Otherwise, a size 10 is slightly roomier than I needed, while still having plenty of room for a custom orthotic, which go into every shoe I purchase. So, that's a good point in favor of the shoe."
nike This is a terrible model. Too heavy for a running/tennis shoe.
nike Excellent for for my hubby.  He loves this style
nike Nice shoes. Good fit.
nike I have owned three pair if these shoes and every time I purchase another brand I keep coming back. I have a wide foot and these shoes fit me great. And even though I have read reviews that talk about squeaking I have not had this problem. But it seems like an easy fix if I do.
nike I have real high arches and these shows have the best arch support of any show I have tried.
"nike I previously had a pair of Monarchs that I loved and that lasted a year before I decided to upgrade to a new pair. I had the blue and white style previously, but saw that the white and black was cheaper this go around, so I bought these. At first, they were about the same, but after about 2 weeks of wear, they started to squeak. It has gotten worse over time, much worse. Now, it has become a joke when near others. It is so loud, you will literally turn heads. You could be in the grass and these will squeak like your stepping on a duck... And yes, both shoes do this...<br/><br/>I don't have the best feet, and these have collapsed a bit on the outside, much more than the others I had previously, but with only 6 months use. I won't buy these again, and it is sad, because I really loved the first pair that I tried prior."
"nike I've bought a few of these at this size. I'm pretty happy with them. I have a neurological disease that, among other things, messes up my feet. I need the wide size. Comfy shoes are hard to find. These qualify."
nike Most comfortable sneakers that I have had in a long time!  I never bought the extra wide before... I should have!
nike my husband bought these for himself and he loves them. he has bought these same shoes before in the past. he highly recommend these.  good comfort and support.
nike Very nice shoe doesn't need breaking in for very long about 2 weeks and not so difficult.
nike I have inserts from the VA for my shoes that give me good arch support so I just take out the ones provided.
"nike Worth the price. Good comfortable shoe. Wear it in the desert where shoes need to be sturdy, with no problems."
nike I bought these for my boyfriend and he always wears a size 10 but these were to small and to narrow for his toes. I was bummed I had to return these.
nike Have worn and jogged for many years(30yrs) in Nike Air shoes and have not had the knee problems of many of my contemporaries.
nike They came very quickly and fit perfect. ha ha nobody else had them love it
"nike These have been the most comfortable shoes ever, and they look great with classic style."
nike They fit great and very stylish!
nike This was not the product that I was expecting. The quality is not the same as the store. Not satisfy. This product is the same price at the Nike store. I will not recommend this product.
"nike nice that I can order a Medium via Amazon, and get the exact fit I need.  Good price too, and fast shipping"
nike They were to big its like its for large people or something
nike the most comfortable all purpose shoes on the market still.
nike My husband was looking for a soft cushiony (?) Heel and this just wasn't  enough.  He had hip replacement so not blaming the shoe really.
"nike Awsome product , very comfortable and on time shipping too. I will definately buy from these guys again !"
"nike The only sneaker my husband wiill wear- he's been wearing these for years, finds they have excellent cushioning in the sole and over all good looks. I hope Nike doesn't stop making them!"
nike Worn them before. The most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned.
"nike the shoes were a bit more than I expected which is awesome, would be better also if I could find a pair from this company and just like these in and old school leather high top not the new style high top. I bought these cause I liked them a lot and wanted a pair of low tops."
nike just what my husband wanted!!
"nike 3rd pair, want to like the, they are comfortable, Air pocket blows out after 2 months. Wasting money at this point."
nike The shoes came quickly and fit like a glove! I've received several compliments on them the first couple days I've worn them. I'm glad I bought them!
"nike Thank you very much for your help and information, I am very happy with the purchase"
"nike This is my third or fourth pair of the Nike Air Monarch.  I think I've had versions I, II and III already.  I just wear them out walking, and after a couple of years, buy a new pair.  Good for walking and tennis.  Not ideal as a running shoe.  Great Nike Air cushions!"
nike Good item
nike Better than advertised - wear them daily in total comfort.  A great shoe for the price.
nike A great shoe and a great price for such a quality shoe.
nike 2nd time ordering these. Love the fit but they were cheaper in store.
nike It was exactly as I thought it would be and described.
nike Perfect.  Good fit and just what I wanted!  Thank you!
nike My husband like it. He was feeling comfortable through wearing shoes
nike Black does not fit the same as White.  By the time you figure it out you can't return it.
nike Great price!!
"nike Shoes have great support all around and the toe box is wide and comfortable. Stable while in play. Well made. I have four other pairs of tennis shoes which I can't wear to play tennis as the toe box is too narrow and tight, causing blisters and pain.  The Nike<br/>Air Monarch fits my feet better than any other shoe I tried on.  Wish they came in more bright colors."
"nike My pinkie toe could use some more room, but I expect the fit to wear in.  With wide front toes and a narrow heal, it is not easy to get a great fit.  My heels slip up and down, maybe the air sole is too stiff front to back, but, they are nice and air-cushion comfortable up and down,  I hope the outers are all leather.  I had some newbalances that were not."
nike Very comfortable. Second pair I have had. Great work shoe.  Very durable as well.
nike He likes his Nikes. He does not like newbalance for his feet. Not as comfortable
nike Great shoes!
nike Great shoes!

nike Great fit excellent value
nike A well-built shoe
nike Shoes do not hold up.  Make a awful squeaking noise.
nike I received the proper shoe in the correct size in a timely manner.
"nike I ordered size 9, but in this tennis shoe it is a litlle bit tight"
"nike I work in retail and am on my feet for my entire shift of 8-10 hours. As I get older, comfort in a shoe is an absolute must. These shoes are very comfortable. They bend with the foot as you walk and are of a normal weight so they don't feel like bricks. They appear well made. Maybe Ill update this when they give out and report if anyone is interested"
nike A great shoes with amazing cushion which helps my back in exercise.  Great product!  Thanks to Nike and Amazon
nike I wear these shoes most every day. They are quite comfortable. I will definitely buy again when these wear out.
nike Love the colors and love the fit.  Just what I had hoped.  Fast and easy peesy.
nike They seem narrow in the toe area as compared to previous pairs of these I have bought.
nike These are the shoes I found to help my Plantar fasciitis. I've experimented with other shoes and the Air Nike really help. I recommend these shoes to anyone with foot problems.
nike Very comfortable shoes.
nike The second pair I have ordered. I love the fit and how comfortable these shoes are.
nike I love shoes that are all black and these fit the description I read the reviews before I bought them and saw that some developed a squeak after they broke them in but I haven't witnessed  anything like that but it's only been a week since I got them. Very comfortable and fit great. I would like to see these no higher than $35 though
nike 3rd pair. Im on my feet all day &amp; they really help
nike My third pair.  I have bought nothing else since I found these (in my size - 13).  Great shoe!
"nike Perfect. Looks good, fits great and very comfortable to work standing all day."
nike very good product excellent service.
nike Husband says this is the most comfortable sneaker he's ever worn. Loves them!!!!
nike Good shoe
nike Perfect fit. Been trying to find shoes that fit my very wide feet. About time
nike Good fit
nike I have a current pair of Nike Monarchs that I like really well--that's why I bought this current pair.  I just wore the first pair out and liked them well enough to order a second pair.
nike My feet apparently shrunk since the last order. All other criteria was excellent.
nike Extremely comfortable! I got them on sale for $50 and the fact that I wear a size 15 4E shoe and  got comfortable shoes for $50 I was very impressed.
nike Just what I wanted!!!
nike WE have been buying this same shoe for years and I ordered the same size that I have been getting for my husband and his toes came right to the end of the shoe. I had to return the shoes and I found the correct size at a local store.
"nike My husband wears them to work. He is very hard on his shoes, but these have held up well."
"nike Was not sure if I wanted these because of all the comments about noise when you walk. Wore them all day yesterday when I got them &amp; most of this morning. But I have not heard any squeeks so far, Well made shoes."
nike I have been wearing this model shoe for years and they are very comfortable.
nike Very comfortable. Lots of support.
nike Perfect
"nike Fantastic shoes. Like these Nike Monarchs were custom made for me where I feel like I'm walking on clouds. Over the past 5-6 years, I've bought 10-12 pairs, that's how much I love these shoes!!!"
"nike This is a very comfortable pair of shoes. I wear them to the gym daily. After six months, there is no sign of wear, loose stitches, etc."
"nike I have had these shoes before and liked them. They take a while to break them in, but after that they are fine. I did have to install an additional foot support in them for the best comfort. Good shoes for the price."
nike Great shoes!! The fit is perfect and I'm always getting compliments on them.
nike They look like old man shoes but are very comfortable. Great for the price!
nike They even came earlier than expected and fit perfectly good price good deal
"nike Maybe I didn't get the w"" size but it's tide, my husband they did liked"
"nike This is the 5th or 6th pair of these I have bought, they are the best shoe for the money that are wide enough for my weird feet."
"nike I've been buying the same brand, these, for the last 10 years and they're great shoes.  Amazon offers a great price.  I'm very satisfied."
"nike Great shoe, But they are too small. I have another pair of the same shoes in a size 10. But these fit like a size 9.5. Had them for 5 minutes And can not wear them. Returning them"
"nike The fit was perfect , it was hard to find in my area, thanks"
nike Perfect fit and very comfortable
nike Very comfortable. Just what i was looking for
"nike I've worn this model for years and love them. They fit great, wear great and look great. The perfect sneaker."
"nike Have worn for years, love them."
nike I've purchased two pairs of the same Monarch IV in White. I like the black ones. They look great and I love the fit of Monarch IV.
nike This is the third pair I have had. I bought another brand last time and they were not as comfortable. The Nike had better support.
nike Muy favorite shoe
nike Love the shoes!  They look great and fit well too..nice and comfortable.  I have nothing to complain about..
"nike Receipient likes them so I'm happy. Second pair I bought him. Other than the squeak, he says they're pretty comfortable. He's flat footed so it's hard to find something with good cushion. He is on his feet all day as a commercial cleaner."
nike I don't want to gush about these shoes but I have foot and ankle problems and these shoes fit so  well as they don't hurt my feet and ankles.  They are true to size not big or too narrow.  Boy I don't know but I will think about ordering a second pair to have on hand just because these shoes fit so well!
"nike A little tight at first, but broke in nicely"
nike The shoes were exactly as my son described and he said they were perfect
"nike I bought the Men's Nike Air Monarch IV running shoes for my son. He said that the shoes were a perfect fit, since he was in an accident and had surgery on his knee, he cannot wear too many shoes but this pair of shoes were perfect....comfortable and they do not bother him at the end of the day."
nike The stores I frequent all carry the trendy light weight mesh Nike's  They do not last as long as the Air Monarchs and they do not have a comfortable toe box for my foot.
nike Work on concrete and on my feet. These shoes are comfortable an hold up very well.
nike very comfortable and fits perfectly. thinking about buying a second pair.
nike Great sneaker at a good price.  Needed a wide size and this is perfect.
nike Very very comfortable for me as I'm standing and walking most day long.
"nike I thought they would be more comfortable, a little disappointed. They are nice and maybe they just need to be worn."
nike This is second pair purchased.  Finally found a shoe to fit somewhat hard to fit feet.
"nike I bought these for my grandson,he is in nursing school, he loves them. Good price, received them very fast."
"nike These sneakers are always comfortable and provide all day support.  They wear out in about six months, but I give them quite q workout."
"nike We couldn't find the leather in the stores.  All the new styles are the mesh.  These are the best shoes for my son.  Gives him great support, durable and very comfortable."
nike These shoes are just what my feet needed. Helps the pain in my knees.
nike Really nice feeling shoes.  Look like they will last for a long time.
"nike I've always liked Nike shoes, but I can honestly say that I absolutely LOVE these air monarchs."
nike I love the shoes but needed a wider size
nike Great shoe. Fits as expected and comfortable with the first wearing.
nike Great shoe for my big foot. (11 1/2/ 4E).  Use for walking and golf.
"nike We have ordered this shoe many times in the same size throughout the years because of its comfort. This time, however, the right shoe was too small and caused injury to my husband's little toe; so he gave the shoes away. I feel that the sizing has changed."
nike The shoes fit as expected.
nike Very satisfied with the Nike sneakers and the service
"nike My hubby really likes these shoes.  In fact, he liked them so much he had me buy him two pairs.  One for inside the house and one for outside.  Highly recommend."
nike I'm going to have to send them back I thought I was getting for 4ee
nike Fit perfect.  Could only find wide shoes in stores.  Great options!
nike LOVE these sneakers; too bad this color cannot be found any longer.
nike I usually wear a 11.5 or 12. I have to order a 13 in this shoe. Been buying this shoe for a while and like them
nike Great shoes
nike These shoes are functional and serve their purpose. Do not expect the performance of a 100 dollar shoe and you will be pleased.
nike Works shoes for my husband - great shoes great price
nike I stand up all day and these are great shoes for anyone in retail.
nike LOVE THIS SHOE  ONLY SNEAKER I WEAR  BEEN WEARING IT FOR 10 YEARS.
"nike Super comfortable. I wear them all the time, this is my second pair. Seems like the stores I went to did not carry size 11.5, their loss your gain. Price was nice too, just a few dollars higher than the store price."
"nike I probably should have gone with 10.5 e but i didnt see that as an option. The shoes are a tad too tight, but i will have to live with them."
nike This is the only gym shoe my husband will wear. He goes thru about 2 pair every year. Very comfortable shoe!
nike Love them. They are very comfortable.
"nike Aren't as comfortable as my old Nike monarchs, but they are okay."
nike My husband was very happy we were able to find these. He bought them 4-5 years ago and loved them. When he tried the new ones on he said ahhhh the support. Happy happy :)
"nike I purchased a 15, fits well. I wear 13-14 in other, similar shoes. Nikes run small, be advised."
nike great shoe.  i have chronic foot problems and this shoe allows me all day comfort.
"nike Great shoe, gotta spread the word..."
nike Very pleased with them
nike Grandson is a mailman and he needed something comfortable in black these fit the bill just great he loves them.
nike They feel like your walking in air. Thats one comfortable pair of sneakers.
nike I loved the first pair that I bought at a local retailer so much I ordered an identical pair on line.<br/>Use them for tennis and pickleball.
nike I ordered the same exact size and type as I was replacing. But they didn't fit real well on the top of my foot. Which was very unexpected. After wearing them in they stretched out and worked ok. The package delivered within the specified time window.
nike Great fit especially comfortable for a wide foot.
"nike Bought this shoe many times 11.5 4E, it is great!"
nike Those shoes are awesome and comfortable. Item just as described
nike Ordered the wrong size thinking I could stretch it out.  Wrong.
"nike 2nd time purchasing..Hope they never stop making these, so comfortable much more than others I've worn, and they look great!!"
nike I recieved my shoes and they fit perfectly.  I have had some bad experience with online ordering when it comes to shoes.  Some of the shoes I have ordered have been tight on my feet and I have not been able to wear them.  These were a perfect fit and the price was half of what I am use to paying in stores!
nike Best running shoes I have found.  Nice and wide in the front.  They fit perfectly.  This is my second pair of the same kind.
nike Nice and just as expected. Father loves them. Very comfortable

"nike Great for my need , ( jogging ) ."
nike Got these for my father and he loves them! These are the only shoes he will wear!
nike Each year come back to buy these for my son that swears by them.
nike Excellent Training shoe. Fit as expected and gives arch support.
"nike In the past these shoes have squeaked; there are other comments that tell how to resolve that issue with powder (and it does work). This pair didn't have the squeak, so maybe they have fixed the issue all together."
nike He wears an 11.5 4E and they fit perfectly.
nike My husband has worn this shoe for years.  If it wasn't comfortable.......he would let me know.  Good all around shoe.
nike intersole had to be tore out for my Orthodics. Now all is well...
"nike Excellent shoe.  High quality.  Comfortable.  Just replacing old pair of same model, which lasted years, and I run/walk over 1,000 miles/year.  Highly recommed.  Great value."
nike I keep buying these because they are a super comfortable fit
nike Perfect all around
nike I was very pleased with the quality and fit of the shoe.  They were very comfortable on the very first day I wore them .  I plan to buy a second pair in the future.
nike product squeeks when walking and shoe hurts my feet i wore them for a month just to see if they would get any better and they just got worse. do not buy!!
nike good
nike I always buy the Air Monarch because they fit great from the moment I put them on. I suffer from heel spurs and these sneakers have such good arch support I don't even need orthodics with them. The only problem is they tend to squeak when you walk. not a big deal.
"nike Fast, accurate and easy to deal with. Couldn't ask for more"
"nike I have short, flat, wide feet. These are heaven on my feet."
"nike Thought it worn a little they would stretch, buy they are still too tight, make sure you order next size up."
nike Fast delivery and good product
nike That will be my  size  from now on<br/> It fit perfect Ty
"nike My2nd pair , great shoes<br/>4e not as wide ass it sounds"
"nike Not a runner, but I wear these all day and they are very comfortable."
nike Arrived on time and good fit.
nike Great shoe.Super comfortable.
nike Very good and comfortable fit
nike Not as breathable as I hoped.
nike Have worn Air Monarchs for several years...  Great Shoe..
nike These shoes are very comfortable. I have purchased these many times. They do squeak a lot.and don't last as long as expected.
"nike This pair of shoes feel very comfortable. The sole is about 1.5 inches, which is pretty thick in my mind. They are durable build and can last long if used mainly for walking. They are not designed for running and mountain climbing, but they can do the job.<br/>They do give the sound other people have described. I can ignore it."
"nike Bought these for the hubby after back surgery. Has both the black for work and white for everywhere else. He loves them! Comfortable, wide enough and great support!"
nike They were to small can i get a bigger size
nike I am satisfied with these shoes They are very comfortable and give good arch support
"nike My boyfriend loves these should,  they are his work shoe"
nike have been wearing this style for ten years and love them
"nike Just changing color, already had the same shoe in white."
"nike Very good shoes , could be made more comfortable for long walks !"
nike I have been using these shoes for years at the gym and they are very comfortable and last a long time.  I love the convenience of being able to by them online at a reasonable price.  I have had them squeak in the past but only after wearing them for a few months.
nike I love Nike monarch only shoe I can wear all day and my feet don't hurt
nike Need to return for a bigger size. Nice shoes otherwise.
nike Great shoes !
"nike Great shoe ,been wearing it for years and expect to continue to wear them in the future"
nike Second pair and they fit great and have held up well despite the abuse.
"nike used to be hard to find these, now the prices are more competitive."
nike I've worn this model shoe for years. I usually buy a new pair every year. I like Nike better than Reboke.
nike Excellent sneaker and on my umpteenth pair thru amazon..
nike Perfect shoes for walking!
nike It fits as expected.  Arch support is where I need it.
nike I use them every day for work good fit and comfortable
nike fit just like last time I ordered the same size. Glad they still make them.
nike Nice fit for wider feet. The only drawback with the wider style (4E in my case) is that it looks more triangular than round towards the front of the shoe. Still happy with the purchase though
"nike Like others have reported, expect for these babies to squeak after a while.<br/><br/>for my situation however, the squeaking doesn't bother me, I just need a long lasting powerful, comfortable and good looking shoe and this in my opinion is all of that."
nike I love the Nike monarch and this is the only place I found that had them in black and white. They arrived on time and fit great.
nike Got exactly what I paid for and for a great deal too!
nike Greet shoe four the price
nike Wears well and very comfortable as an all purpose shoe. On my third pair and not disappointed
"nike Pleased with delivery, and quality of these sneakers"
nike I've had several of these shoes over the years because they fit really well and are comfortable for walking.
nike Nice shoes
nike Needed the extra width and softness of air step. Sensitive foot tendon..these are great.
nike I buy this size in this same style all the time and never had a problem with themy being smaller than usual.
"nike It has met my expectation,  I like the way it fits."
nike The socks and the Nike shoes fit and feel wonderful
"nike Great shoe, comforable."
nike Excellent
nike love them
nike It is my sown fault that I bought them too small.  I just did not remember what size I needed.  Sizes differ between brands.  But otherwise I really like them
"nike I'm so happy with my purchase! Exactly what I was looking for, very fast shipping and perfect fit!"
"nike Structure of shoe is more supportive than flimsy tennis shoes, air cushion, shoe is heavier and clumsy because there is more material, size is good and fits well with bulky sock, wider sole supports foot for running and tennis."
nike Shoes too small for size I had given
nike Excellent sneakers well made extremely comfortable
nike too rugh
nike Great shoes. Have worn this style many years now and ordering online is sure easy and saved a lot of time.
nike Really like them I have been a newbalance wearer for years. These so far feel much better.
nike I will order it again but the size chart could be better.

nike work on my feet all day...my 3rd pair  love them
nike Ver comfortable court shoe. This is my 5th pair.
nike great price great show very happy with purchase.
"nike Great fit, but a bit heavy. Overall, good shoes."
"nike Slightly wide for me,  but close enough. No squeaking yet after 2 weeks. Comfortable."
nike i have this shoes for 2 months i bought amazon for work<br/>but only worst thing which is always annoying is the sole of these shoes very low quality and when you walk it start making noises chuu chuu which is don't like it
nike Decent shoe at a great price.
"nike great show,but nothing helps my ""bad"" feet !"
nike Shoes fit and feel great!  Are very comfortable!
"nike Nice fitting, comfortable, all around good shoe"
nike Nice wide sneakers.
"nike Even though I already had similar sneaker and I ordered this one according to that, it was wide and big."
nike Nike for wide widths. I used to wear Newbalance. They are great for a wider foot.
"nike Fits very well.<br/>Good cushioning and support.<br/>Good for running, walking and casual daily use.<br/>Good price."
"nike I HAVE THE WHITE,BLACK AND RED PAIR..THEY DONT SQUEEK A LICK ! JUST A ""BAD ASS"" LOOKIN PAIR OF SHOES!! I'M ORDERING ANOTHER PAIR IN ANOTHER COLOR CAUSE I LIKE THEM SO MUCH...SWISH ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ"
nike Great pair of tennis shoes.  My 21 year old nephew needed a new pair of tennis shoes and asked if I'd buy him a pair.  I picked these out and had them shipped to him.  After receiving the shoes I asked how he liked them and he stated he loved them.  As long as he is happy I'm happy.  So far they seem to be handling the rough treatment expected by a young adult.  No issues at all with the shoes or the fit.  I ordered the same exact size he wears in tennis shoes that are purchased in the big box stores.  Great product and loved being able to ship them directly to him which saved me time and money.  Great Product and would buy again.
"nike I ordered wrong width but he loves the shoes and does wear them, it's nothing to do with you guys it my fault,and he won't return,I don't know what with is a little bit smaller than these.thanks"

"nike This is my husband's second pair of Nike Air Monarch IV shoes. I should have gotten a wider size, but he can still wear them. Good quality and good price!"
"nike Had these in white for years.  Needed new shoes and went straight to the Air Monarch again,.  No regrets."
"nike I will be returning these because they do not fit. However, that is not the fault of the seller."
"nike Christmas gift, wear this style all the time."
nike Husband loves these! Perfect fit and comfort.
nike Good shoes good fit good price good delivery.
nike the most popular shoe in the service industry
nike These shoes seem to run small in size. I normally wear size 10. I should have ordered 101/2
nike Fit nice with a slight arch support that I like.
"nike I've been wearing 12 for years last couple hurt my toes so went for 12.5 much improvement but next try 13,"
nike This has always been a great long term shoe line for Nike and I keep buying them
nike Great price and great customer service. The only show I wear and can all ways count on your company to have them.

nike My husband loves his new Nike Air Monarchs.
nike Finally a shoe that fits my husband's feet!
nike Comfortable but a little larger than I thought. But no matter. I work in them and don't need a snug fit.
nike I use my orthotics with the sneakers and they are very comfortable.
nike Good impact resistance. Tight fit. Perhaps need breaking in.
nike The size was perfect and they arrived on time.
"nike I wear those for work all day, Great shoes if you don`t mind the squeaking that occurs a few weeks in"
"nike Excellent product, perfect fit, quick service. Great experience."

"nike I purchased these shoes for my 83 year old father with diabetes and swelling in legs and feet, the shoes have proven to be a good fit for his condition."
"nike Fit perfectly, nice and wide, looks great."
nike I saved money with Amazon. 5 stars Nike ..
"nike Just slightly smaller than I expected, but I'm sure they will stretch a bit.  Otherwise a great shoe!!"
nike they seem to run a size to small but a awesome shoe last years
nike Great. These wide shoes are hard to find in stores. They are very comfortable.
"nike 3rd time buying these and apart from the occasional squeak that I placate with baby powder, I'm good to go. Great, comfortable product."
nike Comfortable fit for an extremely hard foot to fit.
nike This is about the 5th or 6th pair I have worn and I always come back to them. I wish they were a little lighter but still an excellent shoe
nike Excellent shoes! I work on my feet 40+ hours and these lasted about 8 months before they really needed to be replaced.
nike It fit as expected and these shoes are very comfortable.
nike #rd time buying these same seakers husband loves them no complaints good price and came fast had them in less then the 2 days
nike Ok<br/>Recibido hoy 06/09/17
nike Love these shoes.  I hope they never stop making this style!
"nike This pair walks 2 miles a day, five days a week on concrete and are not wore out. All other brands lasted 5 months. My feet have large arches and no pain after 11 months. Leather is not torn and soles have tread. Add $8 inserts and you have the best. Thanks Nike."
"nike It was the sneaker specified, everything was fine, I bought them at Amazon before. But the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because one (left) squeaked! I hope when I start wearing them when it warms up they don't. I know I could have returned them, but...."
nike Did not like the heel felt when walking.
"nike My husband has a heel spur, was recommended by our Dr. to wear Nike Air shoes, and they really work to relieve the pain."
nike good quality
nike Very pleased
nike Look like over padded orthopedic old man shoes. They are comfortable though. Just look huge.
nike Talked my daughter into trying my type of shoes.  Now she will not wear anything else.
nike I have to wear arch inserts from GOOD FEET stores.
nike It is a pleasure to find shoes with a comfortable wide width.
nike Great shoes had my last pair of these shoes for 2.5 years and I still wear them but figured it time ot get new ones. The old ones are still in great shape the wear in the soles is great.
nike Got exactly what I wanted
nike Very comfortable and came how described
nike The ONLY wide Nike that's worth a damn.
nike Its like a basic trainer its good but I think I would have rather spend more for the extra confort and support.  After 5 miles my right shoe started tearing up my toe pinky.
"nike good shoes, even though they're Chinese made .... they don't last as long as others, but while they're 'whole' a good shoe - not GREAT !  good"
nike Very comfortable shoes but worn out very fast...
"nike I chose the excellent rating for these shoes because I've owned and worn out these shoes before. They are durable,comfortable,affordable, and a decent looking shoe. If they keep making them I'll keep wearing them."
nike my husband always buys these. my son says it's the favorite of old men. must be a reason.
nike Great shoe--looks as good in person as it does in the picture-- No squeak in mine at all
nike These shoes are making my husband's knee feel much relief at work.
"nike I'd say it's worth $45 opposed to $60 being that it's not a better quality in my opinion.  The back is also pretty low or not contoured for my foot as it can easily slip out while the shoe is properly secured.  Other than that, the design is okay and it's Nike.  I have good luck with Nike products.  I've only worn the shoes once, so we'll see..."
nike Great sneaker most comfortable shoe I have worn
nike My husband is most happy with the fit!
nike Just a tad long but otherwise all good
"nike Best pair of work shoes I have ever had.  I am on my feet for 10 hours a day in a warehouse, and these are super-comfortable and sturdy!"
nike I liked the looks of the shoe but it's size ran so small that I couldn't try wearing it to know if it felt nice to walk in.  It might deserve a higher star rating but can't judge it due to size. I normally wear a 9 and this was a 10 and still too small.
"nike I did not order WIDE, but that's how they came. They were for my Husband, and he felt the width was only slightly too much.  We do love this Model of NIKE shoes."
"nike Great shoe, comfortable, on concrete all day"
nike Saved me lots of time searching stores.
nike Everything I've come to expect from Nike over the last 30 years.
nike Nike shoes perform the way I expected and maybe even a little better.
nike So far so good. Haven't had the opportunity to wear them longer than a couple hours.
nike It's very comfortable.
nike Love the shoes. They fit just right.
nike Are exactly what I wanted.  Perfect.
"nike Perfect, wide and sturdy, love them."
nike best shoes I 've had for a long time

nike awesome
nike Very comfortable. I also bought a pair in white.
"nike Recent back surgery has changes my bio mechanics. These help,walking the best."
nike Good fit for my wide feet; good arch support and padding
nike Use Orthotic Insole inserts to provide good support.  I have worn this model for a long time.  It is one of the few that always fits my feet and provides comfort for a whole day.
"nike Just what I wanted. Had previously owned same shoe, love them."
"nike comfortable shoe and nice quality.  The right shoe began ""squeaking"" when I walked after two days.  Removed inside sole liner, put baby powder under it and put it back in place.  Squeak gone!  Did other shoe before the squeak started.  This squeaking sound comes from the liner rubbing against the base and is a common problem with these shoes. They are very comfortable and look like they may last a long time with limited wear. What do you expect for under $60?  I found that lacing them through the last hole that is normally empty and then pulling the opposite lace under that loop and then pulling down to tighten will make them more comfortable and put your weight on the ball of your foot. At the same time I bought these I also bought a similar pair by Adidas and they are just as comfortable and have no squeak.......yet."
"nike Great shoes, i'll be buying again."
nike great sneakers!  very comfortable!

nike My husband likes the fit although he has two of these pair that after a short time start to squeak when he walks so then he orders a new pair.  He likes the fit I think they break down too quickly for the shoes to start squeaking as soon as they do.

nike I ordered these shoes to replace an old pair that I use to ride bike. I am very pleased with their performance.

nike My husband loved the shoes.. Very supportive for him and they were comfortable.
nike they are very comfortable. I use them for work...where I am on my feet 8-12 hours a night on a concrete floor.
nike Love the shoes and the price is great.
nike Been wearing the Nike Monarch Shoes for years now. Very comfortable. That's why I buy them.
nike I don't like to shop so ordering online makes it easier. It turned out that these shoes were too small so I had to order a larger size (which were perfect). Size numbers between manufacturers varies greatly so make sure you know your size for that manufacturer.
nike TOO SMALL
nike Had to put an additional insole to get a better fit.
nike Great item. Promptly shipped. As described.
"nike Looks on the large size, but is actually lighter tha it looks...i use these shoes for riding my<br/>electric bike and the usage is perfect...i had struggled to find the perfect shoe and i think<br/>i found it..."

nike love this shoe
nike The shoes were previously worn!<br/>I had to clean them
nike Good!
nike They are perfect. My fianc√© loves them. Thanks
"nike Nice shoe, recommended"
nike Because I had these shoes before
"nike Nice leather shoes. Fairly recent manufacture date on tongue, which is what the warranty is based on. I purchased a pair of Nike shoes a while back which fell to pieces, which is unusual. I contacted Nike about the problem and even though the shoes were only a month old, they had been in the store inventory for 5 years and out of warranty. Nike did not replace them. Look at the tag on the tongue when you buy Nike products and only buy the newest date."
"nike Perfect fit, I love them.."
"nike The seller has excellent customer service, they exchanged them for the next size bigger. They still fit snug but I think will be fine."
"nike Expecting it little sleek- comfort is okay not great. I purchased as I have injured my leg, so if you have same situtaion you can use these for some time not for regular use is what i felt"
nike I get a lot of complements on the sneakers
nike very comfortable shoes.  good for walking in the morning and going to  a movie at night
"nike Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!"
"nike nice shoe for the money, will get another pair.<br/>very comfortable....nice with black jeans..."
"nike EXCLLENT QUALITY , GREAT ARCH SUPPORT"
nike I love it
nike most comfortable shoe I have had in quite a while.
nike I was the Oregon state sprint champ long ago - so I am picky about my tenny's.  I use these to jog in when able but mostly for knocking around.  Walking the dogs and everyday use.  I always buy 1/2 size big so I can put in an extra insole.  I've been buying these same shoes for years<br/>They are well built.  I always keep a new pair in the closet. They clean up easily.<br/><br/>Walking thru wet grass is the only drawback as it degrades the glue at the toe line and the sole  separates..
"nike Roomie in the toe section. Great for people with wide toes..I don't know all the width measurements, so they are a little wide for my hubby..but...he's wearing them. Loving them! :-)"
nike Correct fit and color
"nike Great fit, comfortable-especially for anyone who works on their feet all day."
nike Fit great

"nike I have been wearing this model ""shoe"" for years, ever since they came out. They are very comfortable for walking or running and last !"
nike I wear these all the time and they made them harder to buy but I will continue to search them out.
nike Some what narrow
"nike Our son's public school requires totally black or white shoes.  The uniform store sells one, but not as comfort as Nike.  So, this worked perfect for our very active son."
"nike Perfect, very suitable."
"nike Typical nikes, a little narrow but once you break them in, completely awesome."

nike Just what I expected.  I have had them before and that is why I ordered that specific item.
nike this was a great Christmas gift and looks well with jeans or casual pants.  Use leather oil to keep looking new and seal from water and other weather elements
nike great
nike Small
nike Fits ok. Inside sole lining was folded in the toe area
"newbalance The style update ""V4"" of this shoe has much less padding around the heel notch (top of the rear heel) than the prior versions. It's a shame because I loved prior versions of this shoe (this is my fourth pair of MX608) but the new V4 design gave me blisters at the top of my heel the first time I wore it for a long walk because the rear edge of the shoe is so sharp. Because this became apparent only after longer use I felt I could not return the shoe, but I am giving them away.<br/><br/>I was hesitant to write a bad review because I bought the shoe online -- maybe it's my fault for not buying shoes in a store to check the fit? But as the problem is due to newbalance's redesign I thought I should share it.<br/><br/>My Wistful Note to newbalance: Why do you insist on ""redesigning"" this shoe every 1-2 years? Are your designers bored? Do they have a quota? Does removing 3mm of padding save a few cents on production costs? We humble customers fell in love with your shoes because they are high quality and comfortable. I would have happily ordered new pairs of MX608 online for the rest of my life, but now I have to go shop for a new brand. Sigh."
"newbalance Have been wearing them for years, a number of different numbers but all resembling the #608. Dependable sizing, great durability and long lasting comfort. And let's not forget how well theu clean up after another day in the back yard."
"newbalance The two pair I have just purchased are the 4th and 5th pairs I have owned.  I'm 6'4"" and weigh 245.  I also have foot issues.  These shoes are like walking around on clouds.  They have excellent support and a wide base sole for stability.  I purchased two pair because I live in them and even shoes need a break. I would consider them to be cheap at twice the price.  I have paid $200.00+ for shoes that were not half as good."
newbalance I usually hate buying shoes on line because you can't try them on but since I have been getting similar newbalance footwear I decided to try ordering these.  I am a woman with a wide large foot and find it hard to get women's sneakers.  I wear an 11 in woman's.  These were wider than ones I have gotten in the past in newbalance which was great.  First wear on the treadmill gave me a blister but I should have known to break them in first.  They feel great now and have wonderful support for my arches.  Love them!
newbalance I have had many pairs of NB shoes over the years. They fit me very well and are comfortable. It‚Äôs really been the only brand I buy. This pair are very disappointing. After only four months of light duty wear the surface on the toe of both shoes is bubbling and separating. I am past the window to return them so I am stuck. When they peel I‚Äôll trash them. That won‚Äôt be long.  I will be shopping other brands now.
"newbalance Second pair this size I have bought my husband; they hold up well and give great support and comfort for whatever he is doing. A great, dependable all-around shoe for an active guy! I wore the women's version for years as a bedside nurse - never a complaint."
newbalance This is my 3rd time buying newbalance 608.  I just like how they cover my feet.  This time I had to order 1 size larger to get the right fit (wear a 9 1/2 but had to get a 10 1/2).  I wore them to the gym today.  They are a little bit stiff so they will need to be broken in some before they fit like a glove.  They look well made unlike some other reviewers have stated.  Only time will tell if they hold up from the abuse at the gym.
"newbalance I've been wearing 608's since they first came out. I was hoping these V4's would have the same fit as I can't stand a high arch and sure enough, they feel great after 4 hours of wear time out of the box. I think they may run a little larger than the original 608's, but it could be my memory. My old 608's are so worn out that I can't read the size on the tag any longer but I seem to recall they were 12.5 US size, which is what I ordered the V4's in and they feel about a half size long in the toe. It's not a big deal as they don't roll or slip on my heel so I'm not going to worry about sending them back. All in all, if you like the fit of NB you'll like these as well. Very happy with my first Amazon purchase."
"newbalance After 3 days the front orange part of the shoe started to peel off and the soles in the shoe are not even in place and mushing around in my feet while working. I am getting very annoyed with newbalance shoes high price and lack of good quality shoes like they were 10 years ago. They throw gimmicks at me in the store like ""these 150 dollar pair of shoes are made in America"" and "" these shoes have a roll bar technology"" well guess what rolled an ankle and the bottom the those shoes were peeling apart. The 608 are cheaper yes but for the shoes not being able to last a week at work is very PATHETIC and DISSAPPOINTING. Yeah being 7 foot 3 may have an affect walking in a pair of shoes. Engineered by someone who is GUESSTIMATING accomodations for a Tall man has to be difficult but the shoes feel like they took the dimensions of a size 13 shoe and tweaked it in cad or something to make it work for bigger feet. As of 9/11/2015 there has been a flopping in right heel and also a squeek noise when I push off that shoe. The shoe looks very sharp but the quality is starting to lack A LOT!"
"newbalance Having worn newbalance tennies for years, I can assure you these have thinner leather, are lighter weight and generally inferior quality than those I've had before.  It seems that newbalance is making this ""downscale"" line for Amazon so they'll be cheaper and ""pop up"" closer to the top of a search. I don't recommend this line, although I plan to continue with their regular line of shoes."
"newbalance My husband has wide feet and we previously purchase a pair of Brooks sneakers. The sneakers were wide, however, not wide enough. Kenny wanted to purchase another pair of newbalance sneakers and when they arrived he put them on and was out the door, so excited with the great fit and being so comfortable. We would recommend these sneakers, Kenny for the great fit and style, me for having a happy footed husband.<br/>Thank you, newbalance!"
"newbalance I now have four pair of the newbalance 608s, if that tells you anything. These are my 2nd pair in white leather. The other two are blue, and gray suede. Fit is very good and they seem to be well padded. Great for walking but I reserve two pair for working out in the gym. I work out five days per week including 20 minutes on the treadmill or track. They hold up well. Recommended."
"newbalance I recently went up a half size for more room and comfort. Been wearing newbalance for years in a size 10.5 but after measuring my foot it was obvious I need an 11. Also, I've always bought a 4E in NB shoes and this last pair of 11 4E size I received were very tight in the toe box, putting pressure on my big toe, so I had to return them. I wish these had a more square toe box."
"newbalance Did not know how to write a a review because they don't fit. It really was my bad though because I wear a thirteen and the largest size they had was a 12.5. I was SOOO looking forward to these shoes because I'm older, work on airplanes and am my feet all day. I have only heard excellent things about this product which is why I ordered them. I know your return policy. Is there any possibility I can return these.???? Thanks. David"
"newbalance It's not mesh, which makes them nice and toasty if you are living in the colder climate.<br/><br/>The support is pretty good as those I paid for much more.<br/><br/>Only wish they last longer, liked 9 months to a year.<br/><br/>I only wish more training shoes are completely black like these.<br/><br/>Hello, manufactures, you know that solid black color sold out the first, right?"
"newbalance I originally purchased the newbalance shes due to the shape of the toe box,  Now I order and reorder<br/>due to the toe box, the general fit, and the distance I get to go in comfort.<br/>  The shoes arrived on time, and were well protected in shipping.  Would I recommend these to others,<br/>Too late, I already have, and have reordered for myself.  I just like 'em!"
"newbalance I recently purchased this particular shoe for my husband. He is continuously reminding me that newbalance shoes are the only shoes that fit him perfectly. He is correct on this point. No matter the style, and there have been several different types, all have fit as if they were made specifically for him. This particular purchase of the newbalance MX608V4 Crosstrainers were chosen as an every day casual work shoe. My spouse is on his feet most of his 10 hour work day and usualy on concrete or other hard flooring, therfore he requires something that can handle the pounding and the pressure his feet go through daily. I personally have found crosstrainers worked for me so they should work for him. There were several color options available but I was looking for something to wear in a casual office environment, therefore I chose the brown suede. For the last week, everyday when my husband walks in from work he exclaims how these shoes are one of the most comfortable pair of shoe he has ever owned. He actually said they ""are more comfortable than the $250 Red Wing shoes I bought"".  As an added bonus, I bought them for under $50. I think at that price I may surprise him with a second pair to have when the first pair wears out."
"newbalance These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I have a condition that looks like Gout, even though my uric acid level is normal. The base of my big toe is very swollen, and most shoes compress that, and that causes varying amounts of pain. These shoes have a stretch panel right behind that spot, and this relieves the pressure, and pain. These shoes also have more cushioning than my previous shoes, so that makes these shoes AWESOME. I have been wearing newbalance shoes for 25 years, because of the 4E width, which don't exist in other brands.  Of course the lowest price and 2 day shipping make this deal unbeatable."
"newbalance I changed from the sued MX623 to these leather cross trainers. I wear  them everyday alternating two pair with the seasons, different colors. Both pair fit great, especially after a brief one day break-in. I had sole and upper material of construction problems with NB shoes. I'm hoping these will hold up at least one season. I am resigned to the fact that these shoes will not last more than one year. That's OK with me."
"newbalance These shoes are great. My son has been wearing newbalance shoes for the past 8 or 9 years or so and he really likes them. He started with NB because they used to be made in the USA however, in recent years they are now made both in the US and overseas.  Even so, he still likes how they are made enough to stick with the brand (which says quite a bit).<br/><br/>These shoes look and feel great on him. They are surprisingly lighter than what I would have expected based on looking at them. The shoes are very rugged and durable and feel like they are good quality. The soles have good traction and they are easy to put on, tie up and adjust the width and also walk in.  The width of the shoe fit him very comfortably with some additional room to spare -- there is also plenty of room around the toes. He has also said that the insole is very comfortable to step on and feels good on his feet when walking.<br/><br/>Overall, he likes these shoes and said he would definitely want them again."
"newbalance I've always liked newbalance,but for some reason the left shoe always feels like my foot is walking only on the rightside of the shoe and your foot is sliding inside the shoe.  I bought this size in a medium width knowing it would be a little tight to stop the sliding effect, but it did not help.  It could just be me getting older but then who knows."
"newbalance Probably shoes are as individual as anything people buy.  This shoe fits me perfectly, allows for my custom orthotic to fit in. I had been wearing a newbalance 623 but this seems to be a similar shoe, better made and better looking.  My last pair of 623's squeaked badly and I could not find a solution for that problem.  This pair fits perfectly and looks really good."
"newbalance Years ago my podiatrist recommended newbalance shoes.  With metatarsalgia, I have to wear inserts. I have consistently bought newbalance shoes and these were exactly as all the rest - good fit, good construction, good quality.  Previous newbalance shoes have lasted me 2-3 years and I don't see any reason why this pair shouldn't last that long."
"newbalance My teenage son thinks this look very bland and uncool, but I have always considered such a shoe, in all black, a classic and very useful.  One thing I like especially is the small loop behind the ankle which helps to pull them on, because my main gripe about past shoes is that if you step into them, eventually the foam will roll and stick to itself, rendering the shoe uncomfortable and ready for trash.  I wish the design would be modified to stitch the foam in back and hold it captive so it can't become dislodged.  Or, I shouldn't step into the shoe, but I suspect many people do (plus it is uncomfortable for me to do otherwise due to various injuries."
"newbalance Most comfortable training shoe that I've ever worn!  After working out in this sneaker, I ordered two more pairs just in case. It's soft but supportive and LIGHT.  The only change that I made was to install thicker laces. This is one great shoe for training if you have wide feet. Easily the most comfortable trainer that I've ever used."
newbalance My husband loves there shoes it is all he wears probably the 8th pair I have purchased for him in 10 years. Came as expected looked great. Hubby wears a 4E shoe so it is hard to find shoes he likes these fit a bill!
newbalance We have used newbalance products for over twenty years and have always been happy and satisfied. This pair is smaller than I expected and fits tighter in the toe than previous pairs. I should have ordered a half size larger. However the quality is there and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the size not the quality.
"newbalance Great shoe style that I have worn for years. I'm a big guy (250lbs), and I need solid foot support, plus I pound the crap out of sneakers doing 3-4 miles a day on my treadmill. After weaning these for about a year as ""dress sneaks"" they are my daily treadmill foot wear and last about 7-8 months. Which I think is just fine."
"newbalance This is a nice comfortable shoe.  It kinda looks like an old man shoe.  My buddy makes fun of me and calls them my ""Wendy's burger cook shoes.""  However, this is like my sixth pair.  I wear them at work because the floor as granite, but the shoes are very comfortable.  One pair lasts me between 12 and 14 months of Monday through Friday usage."
"newbalance Usually my husbands right shoe fits tighter then left. In case of these the right shoe was fine and left was way too suffocating tight.  Did an exchange with amazon for another pair. The new pair arrived with the same problem. Returned both.  Considering the fact that this is the model that my husband wears constantly and he is on his 20th pair, I have my doubts that these are authentic newbalances."
"newbalance These NB 608 shoes fit perfectly.  With the proper insert, they are comfortable as a 1300 series trainer shoe.  This is my second pair.  They last about 9 months of daily wear for work or a casual use..  The heal padding is the first thing to go but that has been true of all my newbalance shoes.  I'm sure I will buy them again."
"newbalance newbalance is the one of the few shoe manufacturers that care about people with wide feet.  Most of the other manufacturers must think we can just go barefoot or suffer in a shoe that is too tight. I would love to get about 10,000 people with wide feet and sue other companies that refuse to make wider sizes.  In this day and age where everything is handicap accessible at the cost of millions and shoe manufacturers refuse to accommodate someone with wide or narrow feet?  newbalance has the insight to see a real market here and it has paid off I'm sure!"
"newbalance When I seen these NB's, sold by Peltz Shoes and carried on Amazon, I was definitely interested. I have trouble finding 2E's and here they were.  They fit perfectly, very comfortable and look great.  The grey color is a nice change from white.  I will be ordering another pair , as I know the fit and comfort of these shoes."
"newbalance newbalance shoes have been running small. I never thought I would order a 12, but that's what it took to fit my foot with the current build of newbalance. That said, these are very comfortable, and have a splash of color that you don't always find of NB cross training shoes. Would buy again. A good value, and arrived promptly."
newbalance These are great and comfortable shoes. newbalances that wider feel better and any other shoes my dad has purchased. I ordered these for him as a gift. These are great and comfortable shoes. newbalances are a bit wider and feel better and any other shoes my dad has purchased. I ordered these for him as a gift. Love you
"newbalance Bought in housemate's usual size and though the width was perfect, the toe box was confining to the point that it pressed his toenails down and gave him a blister. Purchased him some rayon-bamboo socks that are thinner than usual and after a week or so of breaking in the shoes, they seem to do with the new socks. Not able to wear regular dress socks or athletic socks with it. The next size up was unavailable at the time in this colour, or would have purchased those to compensate for the length. Not a bad shoe, so far it seems to be holding up well and reasonably well constructed for the price. Have always liked the amount of padding in newbalance tennis shoes!<br/><br/>A note on arch support - it should be fine for wearing for casual out and about or a day of flitting around, but these are not proper running or training shoes, in my opinion, if you need any sort of firm arch support. If you are looking for a daily walking or running workhorse, I personally enjoy Asics Kayano Gel line, although some of the newest iterations of that shoe have changed a bit, and not all find those changes improvements."
"newbalance I need to revise my review. I have ordered this same exact shoe many, many times.  This particular pair is a bit too small.  I checked the size and the proper size was sent.  I also tried on the pair they replaced and they fit fine.  These are just about a thumbs width tighter.  I can't wear them for any extended time.  It's a pity I wore them too much to return."
"newbalance newbalance....<br/>My Go To Recreational Shoes for Decades :)<br/>Tremendous Fit, Comfortable, Well Made....<br/>I use these everyday at home, at work before retiring, camping, hiking, walking just recreating &amp; having fun :)<br/>Fabulous Heel &amp; Foot-bed Comfort!<br/>Retired Park Ranger Mike &amp; Renee<br/>Yakima WA"
"newbalance Finally found sneakers that feel good! Very comfortable! I have been a size 10 for many years and these are even on the smaller size. These will do, but still not the quality of my old sneakers that were made in the U.S.A. All manufacturers need to do a better job of controlling items being imported ... or start manufacturing here again!!!"
"newbalance newbalance is my favorite brand of jock shoes, and 608 is my favorite NB shoe. I loved these 608s so much that I quickly ordered a pair in a different color scheme and am watching for a good price for still others. I have two older pairs of 608s in a style not available on Amazon. They are well past their 500-mile limit for fitness use, but still look and feel great for casual use. I like these all-leather 608s best for winter and wear the lighter-weight 411s with a lot of mesh more in the summer. I'm a Type 2 Diabetic, not using meds, controlling it with diet and walk-walk-walking, and I care about my appearance, so I'm rather picky about jock shoes. This pair's color combination is a special fave. I try not to wear them too much. The laces are a bit long, but that is much preferable to too short."
"newbalance Not the shoe's fault. This is just one of the snags we encounter when shopping for shoes online. I've worn NB shoes for years, so there is no complaint on that front. These just felt a bit too tight in the toe box. I'm currently wearing out a pair of 623s, so I returned the 608s and bought another pair of 623s. Variety may be the spice of life, but I like a sure thing.  ;)"
newbalance The 11 4E feels somewhat tight at the start... the leather will stretch out I hope...I bought 5 pairs in mutiple color combos.. sizing in the royal blue seems more generous compared to others... The cushioning in the grey blood red is something new for the's sneakers... I will have to update as they wear...
newbalance As usual I am extremely happy with my new shoes. I have been wearing newbalance in on form or another for 25 years. Probably but new once every couple of years. Keep uptake great work!
newbalance I wear a size 17 shoe.  You can imagine that I have to search for shoes that fit and are affordable.  These newbalance trainers are perfect for me.  I am so pleased to report that they fit perfectly and are really good looking. The price here on Amazon was considerable less that special ordering them from a store.
"newbalance this is my 4th pair of the 608 line.  i mainly walk about 3 miles 4 times a week.  occasionally might do something else.  I tried other newbalance ""walking shoes"" but always come back to this ""training shoe"" one for the following reasons: 1) stability with wider heal and footprint (2) fit is perfect for my foot-i use a 2E in most newbalance shoes (3) leather uppers give additional support to the shoe and comfort (4) shoe is extremely comfortable and my feet never hurt. I am 6'6"" 220 lbs and wear a 14 2E. I have tried the 623 model, but like this fit better, in case you were wondering."
"newbalance Purchased these for work; which is an all day standing/walking job. I no longer wear these shoes as of last week. The inside padding is worn down so I can feel the sole structure underneath the liner. The upper part of the shoe is ok. For the first time I developed very painful heel issues over the past couple of months. (Since I stopped wearing these shoes the heel pain has almost disappeared.) The amount of money I have spent on inserts could have been better put into a different pair of sneakers.<br/><br/>These shoes look nice and have a wide base. However, they are not made to withstand long daily use. If a buyer intends to only wear them occasionally, then these would be alright."
"newbalance My comment is ""why do they make the shoelaces so dang long???""<br/>I'm just getting around to use these shoes purchased in December and I decided to get new shorter laces for them. They came with 56 inch laces and I just put in 45 "" laces which are plenty long. newbalance, shorten your laces !!!"
newbalance newbalance always makes a great product that fits me like a glove. Love the support and most comfortable shoes I wear. Got these for taking walks after my surgery and I can't say enough positive feedback about them. Makes the transition so much easier on me and my feet. Arrived on time and undamaged. Great show and seller tpp. I will recommend to anyone.
"newbalance I recommend getting sized before you buy any shoe. I used a barefoot step-on sizer, for lack of a better term, during boot camp (military) and they properly gave me this size and this brand. I am no longer serving but I know exactly what shoe size to buy from this brand and continue using these as my running shoes."
"newbalance For years, I would wear 9 1/2 newbalance shoes.....sometime down the road...things changed.....about a year ago I tried size 11, because 9 1/2's are too small now....the 11's are a tad big...but they work....so I figured on these 608's I would try 10 1/2....fit great...my new size is 10 1/2."
"newbalance I've been trying to find a solid pair of newbalance for a while.  I generally like how they fit, but I find that the materials aren't always durable.  I especially have problems with anything that has mesh uppers.  It doesn't take long for things to get stretched or develop holes.  So I was thrilled that these were non-mesh.<br/><br/>They held up for about six months before seams started to separate, and now it seems like something is wearing down on the right side of the right shoe, pretty much exactly where my pinky toe would hit.  Didn't expect my pinky toe to be strong enough to start wearing through the material, but here we are.<br/><br/>My wife is ready to kill me at how often I seem to buy new sneakers (and I only buy them as needed) so maybe it's time to find a new brand."
"newbalance These are cushy shoes that fit well and serve me well for walks of 3 miles. I use flatter shoes for cross-training work, but these would suffice if you were looking for walking and cross training shoes in one. The earlier models I ordered had less of a drop, and were not as bouncy-cushy as the latest pair. I preferred the older ones."
"newbalance If you look at the tip of the shoe, you will see a ""lip"".  In the past, this has not even been noticed, but on this pair (left shoe), the lip came unglued and then the shoe began to fall apart!!<br/>A little Gorilla Glue put everything all back together and holds very well!!<br/><br/>Overall, the shoe fits well and provides excellent stability and support."
"newbalance 608's are the best shoe that I have found for overall wear, walking in the morning (because the doctor said so) and all around otherwise, third pair I have had, wore the other ones out.  Really do like the looks of these to, not a color that you see every day, they look better in person."
newbalance excellent! no 'memory foam insole.  I found the memory foam remembers the deformation on my feet and very promptly becomes so thin there is no support.  I must pull out the liner and tape an 'across the counter' support onto the bottom to support the deformation.  newbalance has always been true to size and excellent support and it took only one memory foam to learn .
"newbalance I was a little worried ordering for the on-line fourth time in four years for the lineage of the old newbalance 608's. Appeared in the reviews that they might be cheap and poorly put together and ""just not as good as they used to be"". I was worried....<br/>So I pulled my white and black 608 V4's out of the nice boxes, checked them closely, put them on and now have worn them for a week or two;<br/>Wonderful!  Perfect fit, seemingly well constructed, and I like them much better than the year old 608 V3 edition that they replaced.<br/>So far, they are just the wonderful cross trainers that I have worn for ten years or more and my feet feel younger than ever!<br/>Heartily recommend from my experience."
"newbalance I have always had issues with finding stores that had my width of shoe plus the style I wanted. This fit the bill and keeps my feet comfy. Office dress shoes, even properly fit ones, don't offer the cushion these offer . I am going to see about wearing something similar to these in the office. I am very happy with them."
"newbalance Great walking shoe. My husband has a problem callused foot and these shoes help with that problem, but after 8500 steps, these shoes become hot. We'd love to see these shoes in a little lighter weight material such as a breathable substance. Overall rating is the confidence we have in newbalance and their desire to produce confortable walking shoes."
newbalance This shoes fit the same as my NB 577's and have removable insoles that allow me to use my arch supports without any alteration of them. They're comfortable. I have only had them a little over a week so only time will tell how well made they are. At this point I am well satisfied with my purchase.
newbalance Fine for lifting weights. No support for even the elliptical.  Feet hurt after just 20 minutes. Would not purchase again.
"newbalance Wore these shoes for about 8 1/2 months.  Soles and uppers show very little wear, but sole of right shoe came unattached from body of shoe. I liked them while they lasted, but normally I can wear a pair of shoes much longer until either the sole is gone, or the uppers start to split."
newbalance These are very comfortable and great looking. I bought another pair in a different color after getting these. I have a size 14 foot and I don't usually buy shoes online because I'm a tough fit but I thought that I'd give it a shot because of Amazon's great return policy.
"newbalance newbalance, To Me,  is the best athletic shoe on the market. They Fit like a Glove and feel like walking on a carpet. They wear well, both in the sole, and on the upper body.  Sizes run very true.  I have been a fan of NB for 30 years and STILL continue to be. GREAT SHOES !!"
newbalance Here's a tip.  If you are older you should think about checking your shoe size.  I was a 17 for quite a while.  My socks were bugging me and I thought it was the socks until I bought a pair of shoes size 18.  All is great now.  You feet keep growing.  Pay attentions.
"newbalance To be fair to the shoe, size is always a bit of a hit and miss event, and it's not as though my feet slip around in them - there's just more room than I expected. I was replacing some very worn out keens at size 14/4E after four years, and have very wide feet, so a little extra room on the length is expected, and a little extra width isn't an issue. It's roomier than the Keens they replaced, and I'm only going to the office these days rather than tromping in semi-rural Japan.<br/><br/>Very comfortable, very good heel support which is important to me - my right foot tries to roll out and back habitually, and I'd ground down that part of my previous shoes through wear and tear. This shoe is correcting that without being uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Very warm shoes - I have to take them off now and then beneath my desk. But if you get cold feet on a regular basis, I'd definitely recommend them. And my need to nudge them off and on probably contributes to the slightly loose feel.<br/><br/>Very comfortable for a good price, and accommodating to my wide feet, happy I could find 4Es. In theory I probably could've gone with a 13/5E, but for going to work every day these are perfectly fine at a great price."
"newbalance My son loves them, they are very comfortable and with his wide foot it is hard to find good tennis shoes that fit him well. . Love newbalance for their great fit and durable shoes.  I have learned when buying shoes you get what you pay for and newbalance are well worth it."
"newbalance I love these shoes! I bought these as a replacement pair in black, for the navy ones I used to own. I wore them down until there was not much left. They fit just as great as the previous pair did and provide ample support for everything from yard work, day to day wear, weight lifting, running, etc."
"newbalance I got these for my son; my husband and son only wear newbalance athletic shoes. I ordered a few different styles and sizes for him to try. And though these fit OK, the backs of these shoes went up too high, rendering these unwearable for him, which is the only reason I deducted one star.  Everyone's feet are different, so this may not be a problem for some others, but it can be, as it was for us. I guess as with any shoes, you really need to try them out for yourself.<br/><br/>So unfortunately, we did need to return these and get another style. However, overall, if the back of your ankles/heels are high, then I think they may be worth giving a try. If yours are lower, then you might want to try the following: He ended up with the newbalance Men's MX636 Training Shoe, and the backs were lower and these fit him like a glove - he loves these. He said they were really comfortable from the start and still thinks they're great."
"newbalance These shoes were purchased to wear with a uniform (khakis/shirt) for a volunteer role that requires standing for long periods of time on pavement and concrete. They are tremendous! Super comfortable, supportive, and look close enough to a casual dress shoe to look better than a running-type sneaker."
newbalance My husband wears these for work shoes and loves them. He said they are so comfortable and have such great support that there is no need for breaking them in. I ordered two pair because he liked them so well. He is on his feet alot on concrete floors during the work day.
newbalance I have  grey and brown pairs of this shoe and both are rough suede but this pair is of an almost smooth material that doesn't feel like leather . the shoe laces are much thinner than the other two pairs also . I wish newbalance would't change their specifications and stick with what works . This pair feels cheaper than my other newbalance shoes . They almost feel counterfeit  although I know they're not .
"newbalance Best fit ordered on line to date.  Superior to Nike, which was a bit stiff and tight even though published sizes were identical.  Very comfortable and easy to put on.  Limited wearing time till now, so cannot comment on longer term wear and comfort, but out of the box I am very pleased.  Certainly meets comments and input from third parties ignored until now due to Nike fixation.."
"newbalance These are great walking shoes.  I would not recommend them for running though. I have been away from running and bought these for walking on a treadmill and as a leisure shoe.  I am going through a ten week walking program and hope to begin jogging at the end of April.  I just purchased the newbalance Men's Vazee Pace Running Shoe for running and will be reviewing them shortly.  I am a huge fan of newbalance. They support Americans with jobs and don't make weird shoes, like some companies.  Maybe I am too traditional or maybe I don't like people staring at my shoes as I run by."
newbalance Shoes came quickly and well packaged. Now heres the interesting part and this isnt the sellers issue. Some years ago newbalance change their sizing so  if you wore a size 14 you have to order a size 15 to get your shoes to fit. I have old pairs marked 14 that are exactly the same length as the new 15s. newbalance also changed the cut of the width at the forwardpart of the shoes making them slightly wider for the same width as earlier shoes. If you have large feet like me youll severely notice the difference as compared to say a size 8. The shoes are comfortable and fit OK but not as well as the older styles of newbalance. This is the 2nd time Ive been disappointed by newbalance and I think Im going to start looking at other brands.
"newbalance I've only had these shoes a short time but have worn them several times now for good amounts of time and love them.  I got the 2E width because I have a somewhat wider foot and they fit perfectly well.  I was a little surprised at the comfort level as I wasn't expecting a lot but the comfort is great and it has much more arch support than I was expecting too.  All in all, I am extremely happy with the 608 and plan to wear them all day tomorrow for the opening football game of the season.  That's how confident I feel about the comfort of this shoe.  I got them in the grey color and I think they are a very nice looking shoe in that color so that's a bonus.  Highly recommend."
newbalance They work great for me the fit is perfect I use a dr. Scholl's custom orthotic that you can pick up at any Walgreens or other drugstore that carries the fitting machine that is required to determine which orthotic is proper for you I highly recommend you give that a try with any of your shoes. They have a machine that you stand on and it measures your foot not precise but for weight distribution and then recommends the proper orthotic for you which they have right at the machine they're not cheap but they're a lot less expensive than a custom orthotic and they work great for me I recently got back from Spain where we did a tremendous amount of walking and between the shoes and the Orthotics I did just great. And I tend to have problems with my feet when walking on uneven surfaces which are all over Spain. Good luck.
newbalance This is about my 6th or 7th year with the same style and I love it. They arrive early<br/>and fit just right. My old ones are now my yard work shoe and the new ones are my<br/>knock about in. And yes if you mistreat them the soles will separate......Thanks
newbalance newbalance is the only tennis shoe i buy.. As usual i can buy 13D without trying them on and always a comfortable fit . i usually like the upper # shoes but i like these all leather shoe i can where for casual outings look nice. I recommend these shoes
"newbalance This is my third pair of 608s, and version 4 extends this line of very comfortable shoes. newbalance obviously is listening to previous wearers who love the fit and the comfort, but weren't so entranced with the look. This version of the brown suede 08 is darker, and the ""N"" blends a bit more into its background. It's still obvious that this is a NB crossover shoe, but it looks almost elegant. I can certainly get away with wearing it in my daily work, except for truly formal situations.<br/><br/>And that's good, because this is really my go-to shoe for comfort and support. The included insole is a simple piece of foam rubber that is easy to pull out and replace with your own orthotics. Good thinking."
"newbalance I picked up a pair of these for work.  I had been looking for something all black that I could wear that was not a dress shoe. I needed something with a bit more comfort for the day to day.<br/><br/>I still have a pair of leather dress shoes under my desk for use when needed.  Since these are black, I am not sure anyone really notices."
newbalance Replaced 6 year old NB similar to this.  The sole seems a little bit lighter.  Don't know how well they will hold up in comparison.  But over all satisfied.  Fit just like the 6 year old shoes I wore almost everyday.  If I get 4 years I'll be very happy with them.
"newbalance A little larger than I expected but that was expected, I have been buying newbalance  shoes for over 25 Years,They were really good comfortable shoes and lasted for as long as I wanted to keep wearing them But a year ago that all changed.The last ones i purchased only lasted about 4 months. The soles just started coming unglued and fell right off like they were glued on with water soluble glue.The company I bought them from Went out of business about that time.That pair of shoes w #MX623AB3  Mfg 12/20/2015.They sure were Junk I Just hope these are Better Made.Thank you for asking, I am 80 years old and pretty easy on shoes.Herman M."
newbalance Fantastic shoe for that price. I installed a beefed up insert when they arrived and you can keep your $200 athletic shoes; these are great and comfortable and fully supportive in all areas of my feet. Get a pair and torture them and see if you agree.
"newbalance Like the style. The fit, not so much. A bit narrow. Too early to rate the durability.<br/><br/>Update June, 2017: Hard to believe it's already been well over a year. The shoes are holding up well, look good. Even received some compliments. The shoes fit better now, either they have stretched a bit or my feet have shrunk. For that reason I'm changing the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars."
"newbalance I have worn NBs for many years. My last ones, MX623, developed a stress crack in the vinyl uppers, near the toe.<br/><br/>I looked for leather uppers on my replacement shoes (MX608V4) to enhance durability. The ad on Amazon said ""leather"" so I ordered them. They arrived today. They are comfortable, though do not offer much arch support. I have quality inserts to use, so that's not a big issue.<br/><br/>My big complaint, however, is that I could find NO LEATHER anywhere on the shoes.<br/><br/> I shall keep them; it's too much time and inconvenience to exchange them."
"newbalance I really like the fit, performance and comfort of theses shoes.  The only problem I have them is that the tread has a tendency to come loose from the sole.  While this can be reattached with 3M 4200, it is a disappointment in an otherwise well-made shoe."
"newbalance very comfortable - I have flat feet and usually get newbalance because they don't have high arch supports.  A nike will either fit you, or if that arch is off, is going to wear you out.<br/><br/>Unusual color - gets compliments, go figure."
newbalance I have sensitive feet that are also short (mens 7.5) and wide (2E).  Hard to find comfortable shoes.  These fit well and are comfortable.  Adding a note some time later:  I love these shoes.  I can walk long distances on all types of surfaces.
"newbalance Very comfortable. Nice walker. Why 4 stars not 5. I once owned a pair of walking shoes I'd kill for. Years ago, can't remember the make and model. Never took note being young, I thought all walking shoes must be that comfortable. 10 pairs later I'm still looking for them. This comes close. Think it was a Hush Puppy but I've tried several models and they where very disappointing."
"newbalance I like this shoe, as it looks stylish and meets my expectations for an everyday casual shoe.  I am a little concerned that it will not do well if it gets wet.  I have avoided wearing them in the rain so far, so I don't know if my concern is warranted.  My only negative is that the shoe runs on the small side.  I ordered the same size that I have worn in other newbalance shoes, but this model seems significantly smaller."
"newbalance Not all newbalance 608 v4s are the same.  Some of these like the ""Dark Brown"" are shipped with the standard foam insole and are not comfortable.  Some are shipped with NB ""Memory Sole Comfort Insert,"" made from memory foam rubber, and are very comfortable, like the ""Dark Grey/Navy.""  Check the photos carefully for the different colors of 608 v4s offered.  The ""look down"" photo that shows the inside of the shoe should show the ""Memory Sole"" label.  The good news is NB finally has come up with a 608 (this v4) that rivals the original NB 608 for comfort, but be sure to get one with the Memory Sole insert."
"newbalance I felt it was a bit wider than most other EE newbalance shoes.  Generally, I wear 10 1/2 EE shoes in newbalance athletic shoes.  These came with memory foam.  I don't like the memory foam because I have specialized inserts that don't work well with it.  That being said, they are still better than most athletic shoes.  The arch issues are my feet solely.  (rimshot!)"
"newbalance Nice cushioning. Comfortable for all day use. The only thing I didn't like was they don't have normal eyelets for the laces. They have those cloth loops that tend to rip. Didn't notice them before I made the purchase. Other than that, it's a good shoe."
"newbalance For big guys with 4E wide ""Frankenstein"" feet like me,  newbalance is the only athletic shoe that fits me properly.  Sizing is consistent on the ultra wide width shoes, shoe is very stylish,  and it's comfortable to wear all day. The dark charcoal gray suede color is rich, deep,  and it looks good with the dark red accents.  Shipping was perfect,  delivery on the expected delivery date,  and packing was great.  Happy  yet again with Amazon!!!"
newbalance -1 year update (well.. 11 months)-<br/>The shoes are beginning to show some wear. The fabric on the insoles have bare spots and the heel on one is torn. But the shoes have held up well for the cost. I don't have a habit of taking good care of my shoes and
newbalance I searched for a long time for a really nice shoe for walking. I am typically an Adidas guy but gave these a try. I was not disappointed. They are light and feel really good on my feet. My walks are between 6-10 miles a day and my feet never feel fatigued. The only issue I have is the inside of the shoe near the heel has worn away and I am now getting blisters. I have been using mole skin on the inside of the shoe and a band-aide on my heel to keep if from rubbing.
"newbalance If you are 200+ pounds (like me) I do not recommend these.  They are not very stable and have little arch support. I feel all sorts of motion in them, and my feet ached at the amusement park.  If ur lighter, they just might be fine."
"newbalance I really like these shoes but they were too small. The insole would not lay flat and that made the shoes uncomfortably tight. The shoes are 11-1/2, 2E. The insoles are stamped 11-1/2 4E. They were just too big to lay properly. They are also gel filled so I don't think I could have successfully trimmed them to fit. I have a pair of these shoes in size 11.5 D. I've worn them for the past 6-7 years and they've been great shoes. They are finally wearing out so I'll use them for yard work. It seems that they are cutting them smaller these days. ottom line? If you can order a size larger than you normally do, they are great shoes."
"newbalance This was my first pair of 2E shoes and it won't be my last!  I have worn newbalance shoes for a number of years and in my opinion, you can't go wrong with newbalance.  I think this design is very stylish--- and very comfortable."
"newbalance Bought this for the wife and she loves it!  According to her, it is very comfy, looks awesome and is her favorite shoe.  She's a farmers' daughter, so these are the shoes she mostly wear.  She said the memory foam is just awesome."
"newbalance I have had foot pain for 10+ years. I finally saw a podiatrist, and he recommended these newbalance Training Shoes specifically (model 608). These are WONDERFUL shoes. I spend 10-12 hours a day on my feet on hard concrete, and my feet do not hurt wearing these shoes! This makes the third pair of these I have bought, and the are all awesome!"
"newbalance I have tried many cross-training shoes in my time and the newbalance 608 series are the best for fit and comfort!  Don't even try other newbalance cross-training shoes, you will not be satisfied!  I have owned over 8 pair of 608 over my lifetime!"
newbalance Took a chance and bought some shoes online. They fit perfectly. I have super wide feet and finding comfortable shoes is hard. But these I love... so far
"newbalance These are good looking and a nice weight.  The size is accurate.<br/><br/>I do have a problem with them that you may need to consider  I have an extremely high instep (quite rare I'm told) and I also wear custom orthotics.  The combination causes the upper part of my feet to rub at the top inside shoe surface.  Wearing thin socks works around that problem, though my preference is a thicker padded sock.  I can wear the shoes comfortably without the orthotics for a day or two before having to again swap out the insoles and return to the thin sock.<br/><br/>My guess is that the vast majority of people won't have the issue that I do.  Without the oorthotics or with a more normal foot these would be outstandingly comfortable."
newbalance These are the most comfortable walking shoes I have ever owned. Also acceptable as hiking shoes due to the superior support and heel base. The suede makes them dressy enough and appropriate to wear to work and going out in the evening. The fit is perfect - no pinching or pressure points - even after walking and hiking for 3 hours. Highly recommend this product.
newbalance Wear them at my gym for weight and aerobic exercising. They appear to be a durable shoe which should last; they almost seem like hiking boots. Very comfortable and supportive. They were a replacement for a pair of NB cross trainers which lasted over 3 years.<br/><br/>I bought the widest width and a half size larger to avoid any restriction in the toe area. Even with the wide width there isn't any slop.<br/><br/>The only drawback is the shoe has a large portion of suede outer material. This is an issue only in the winter  months when you walk through a salted/slushed parking lot. I leave these shoes in the gym locker.
"newbalance This pair of shoes provide a comfortable fit.  On purpose, I ordered newbalance because of previous satisfied purchases and ordered the size one size larger than the last time that I purchased shoes.<br/><br/>I am 74 years old and am still a growing boy.  The proof is that my shoe size gradually increased from 12 D to 15 D over the last 25 years.  I will soon be ordering new shoes to replace my dress leather shoes, which are now too small and are a pain to wear.  I want to wear these new shoes for a little while to make sure that they are the right size and not too small.<br/><br/>Gerald Wood who is EAW spouse."
"newbalance I like this shoe, but over the years the stated size seems smaller.  Yeah, feet grow as I grow older...  Really?  Started at 8.5 am now at 9.0 edging toward 9.5.  However, 9.5 is not a commonly available size for some reason.  I'm still going to buy the shoe, but..."
newbalance My husband (who has a very difficult time finding shoes that don't hurt his feet) absolutely loves these newbalance sneakers.  He says that they are one of the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn.  I would definitely purchase these again.
newbalance These shoes are O.K. but the toe boxes are too narrow and the insoles have no arch support.  They are well constructed so they won't fall apart before you wear them out and the soles absorb a good amount of shock when jogging.
"newbalance I like this shoe. I don't love it. May just need more breaking in. Seems a bit stiff but durable. I like the way they look. As I get older, my feet seem harder to please needing more arch support and toe space. I maybe should have gotten them even wider. All in all, a good price for a good shoe."
"newbalance Fits as exspected, ok for occasional use, they wear out quickly when worn 10-12 hours daily."
"newbalance Good quality.  Good fit.  My son wears a 4e in newbalance and a 5e in propet.  Most other brands don't even carry his size.  Here's hoping that this style is more durable than his previous style, which only lasted 6 months."
"newbalance I reordered the exact same shoe that I have enjoyed for a few years now, and just as before, they fit great. newbalance is the only shoe I have found that accommodates my wide feet comfortably. This show is great for walking and for jogging; I highly recommend!"
"newbalance I was concerned with this purchase because newbalance shoes that I have purchased in the past seemed too narrow.  This pair of shoes fit me well.  I like the styling and the quality seems decent.  The price is fair for what you get.  I will wear these shoes in the gym on the treadmill and elliptical trainers.  If I get six months out of these, I will be happy.  Shoes I have purchased in the past (all brands) tend to fall apart at the rear ankle part of the shoes.  I never thought I would be buying shoes on line.  Everything in the local stores were too flamboyant and awfully expensive.  The selection in stores these days really stink.  Psychedelic neon running shoes, not for me!"
"newbalance I am happy with these shoes. They look good, are reasonably priced, and are very comfortable for me.  Compared to the lasts of other brands, the newbalance last fits my feet best with its comparatively lower arch and narrower heel."
newbalance second time ordering these form Amazon as it is the best deal for wide fit
"newbalance I like the newbalance 680's!!  But I have to admit, when I first put them on, I felt as though the heel was very low; like wearing slippers.  I don't think these would make good running shoes (and they're not advertised as such), but I think they will be great for pickleball and general wear-around-the-house use.  After a few hours, they felt fine.  I have found that typically, if newbalance fitted you well years ago, they will likely fit you well now.  Sneaker manufacturers seem to use foot models that they continue to use for long periods of time.  As a result, newbalance and Saucony's work well for me, while Nike and Adidas don't fit nearly as well."
newbalance I really like these shoes.  This pair is to small.  I will try again.  The larger size is perfect.<br/><br/>I like these shoes are perfect for me.  I bought another pair.<br/><br/>Thank you for such a good product.üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
"newbalance I have always liked newbalance shoes.  They are more comfortable for me than other name brand walking/athletic shoes.  I really like it that I can buy the 2E width online.  All of the local retailers I have tried only carry D (too narrow for me) or 4E (way too wide).  newbalance has always performed well and lasted a long time for me in the past.  The only issue I had with these shoes was that the shoestrings that came in them were too long.  When tied, the bows almost touched the ground on both sides of the shoe.  This was easily fixed with a replacement set of laces but I don't think I should have had to do that right out of the box."
"newbalance Received my shoes today and they are great! I wear a size 15 EE, and these shoes give me a great foundation to walk! Amazingly, they are lightweight, stylish, comfortable, and my feet feel really secure! I like wearing these shoes with beige pants, they look great! newbalance is the only gym shoe I will buy because of it's well made quality! Also, the soles have a great grip, making walking in water attainable! newbalance gives you great Balance!"
"newbalance I love these shoes, but now find that my feet perspire more than ever when previously purchased...in 2013..¬†<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/New-Balance-Men-s-MX608V4-Training-Shoe/dp/B00IYAG7DW"">newbalance Men's MX608V4 Training Shoe</a>¬†The Amazon website states that this shoe is leather.  I do believe the site is incorrect and needs to be corrected.  These shoes are definitely synthetic.  I hope Amazon looks into this matter and makes the correction.  I have purchased many pairs of these in the past and they previously were leather, but since they are no longer made in USA, they have switched."
"newbalance newbalance 608's are my husband's go to shoes for work.  He is a nurse and on his feet all day.  He is also a diabetic and has a bad leg with multiple screws and plates near the ankle.  He has to wear good fitting, supportive shoes and the 608's are what works for him. I hope they never stop making them because they are usually hard to find.  I was so pleased to see them here at Amazon!"
newbalance These shoes wear the best on my husband as he is on his feet all day
"newbalance Very good shoes that help my problem with bunions, arthritis and age.  I had to order larger size and width.  Took a little getting used to but the shoes are holding up well and doing what they are supposed to do.  Would buy them again."
"newbalance Bought this because of bad knees and tired of wearing uncomfortable dress shoes, so adopting the old man look lol. Shoes fit and feel wonderful and can walk in comfort. The all black design helps to not stand out so bad when wearing dress clothes. Have read others with problems of coming apart and bad seams due to glue. Have had none of those issues. Will prob buy another pair to have as backup in case they quit making them."
"newbalance I brought the newbalance Men's MX608V4 Training, for my son, because we have problem find his sign at the regular store; and he love it, he said is confortable the color is okay, and met his expectations and need."
newbalance I got these for my son who works long hours on his feet on concrete presently to help with pain in his feet and knees after reading reviews that they are helpful for those situations.  They seem to be a good shoe.
"newbalance I only tried them on so far but I love them,they fit excellently and are nice and light. I don't think you could get a better shoe for the price . I've had shoes for more money that I liked less.<br/><br/>newbalance for life !!!"
"newbalance Shoes fits just fine and are comfortable.  I have a bought several pairs of these shoes in the past. The only problem I have with them is after a few months of wear the sole becomes detached from the top of the shoe.  The glue they use just does not hold for a long period.  The shoe becomes worthless, and I have to replace them even though the shoe top and sole are still in good shape.  Perhaps the manufacturer wants it this way so they can sell me another pair of shoes.  Sometimes I wonder why I keep buying this brand."
"newbalance I have been using the NewBalance 608 shoes for some time now. This is version 4 of this shoe. It's a bit wider than its version 3 counterpart. If I had known it wouldn't fit the same, I'd of bought the v3. Still, a good shoe."
newbalance I had this same one before that I somehow lost. it was a very comfortable and lightweight shoe for a disabled person to wear daily. I am now reconnected with my favorite shoe. everything on it is cool and I will continue to wear it as long as it holds up.
"newbalance I've found that newbalance shoes have been the most comfortable shoes for my feet. I have High Arches and have had Planters Fasciitis previously, so I have custom Orthotics that I use in my shoes. I previously had the MX608V3 Cross Training newbalance and they have been extremely comfortable to wear and durable. I'm not real active so mainly wear them just casually. This MX608V4 does not seem to be as comfortable on my feet. They seem to be stiffer and the footbed padding seems stiffer, making the ball of my foot (below my big toe) become sore. Remember, I use Orthotics for my arch support so can't speak about that, but the overall comfort of the V4 compared to the V3 is not as good. I'll keep them &amp; hope they loosen up more."
"newbalance Husband has very wide feet and will suffer lower back pain standing all day.  These shoes fit perfectly and provide good arch support and did not suffer back pain or leg pain wearing them all day.  I was surprised to learn this particular model of shoe has been approved by Medicare if you are a diabetic.  This gives me peace of mind in our decision to purchase as they are very well made.  They were well packed and arrived on time.  Will be purchasing another pair in the near future.  I recommended them to a family member who is a diabetic but his condescending reply was you have to spend $700.00 for it to be a good shoe.  Well, the joke is on him, we didn't have to spend that much to find a quality shoe.<br/>Thank you Amazon &amp; newbalance shoes!"
"newbalance Just Size issue.  Still a Great shoe if you get the right size which has varied (for me anyway) from the last model.  T he v3 has been a favorite of mine except the slippery traction somewhat.  love this updated v4 because of  its new soles....bought two pair. one for work and one for play and they both fit the same....toooo small.  I usually wear 11 but I tried on the V3s in 10.5  a year or so ago when I got mine (a couple pair to make sure it was feeling right) and they fit fine with xtra room just like normal 11s in other shoes for me.  So I went with 10.5 for these new v4 and they are short/small.  I have to go up to/back up to a 11...and hope they are OK. I've read some reviews about the consistency of NB sizes being off and now I experienced this.  Online shoes charges for returns from Amazon, yet said free returns on there website.  should have gone with there website initially.  needless to say not happy and if charged for shipping despite email, I will not be buying from them again."
"newbalance I don't know if it just happens in my size, but for the last couple of years newbalance shoes have predominantly had uneven footbeds.  They have ""peaks and valleys"" under my foot.  This pair had a pronounced dip under the big toe area which made the shoes uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I appreciated the free shipping return and the promptness of my refund."
"newbalance These run really small.  Not just a half size but a full size too small for me.  I have to exchange them.  Normally I can get a 10.5 4E in newbalance and be good but these require one additional half size larger which would put me to a size 11--and this is in 4E!  That's ridiculous.<br/>Other than that, they are more flexible than  other newbalance shoes I have worn because they have an extra flex slit on the very bottom of the sole which makes them more comfortable to me.<br/>One thing I noticed is that there is a indent or hole type thing on the heel of the outsole.  This seems to add cushion as I noticed a springy like sensation in that area which is nice.<br/>The toe box is on the small side as well."
"newbalance Suppose to be leather. Can't find material description on shoe or box. Why? Not buying 409s anymore because they are mostly synthetic materials now. Suspicious of newbalance, will try someone else next time."
"newbalance I have wide foot, somewhere between D-2e I guess after wearing these. They seem to be on the big side of 2e. I bought them for boxing, so often I feel my foot slide in side the shoe, and lose my balance a little when moving around.<br/>Also, the heel forms a suction cup on soft gym/wrestling mats, again a balance issue. I didn't encounter this much as I try to stay on my toes, but once in a while it happened, and was not a good surprise.<br/><br/>I would say they would be a good gym/walking shoe, but leave them at home when doing anything with a high level of movement and/or agility."
"newbalance I ordered a 7D in men's (which is my correct size and equals a 7 regular width) and it is way too small and tight. I am currently exchanging for a 7.5D although I would have liked to do the next width up but they were out of stock. I kind of feel like I might need a size 8, but I will wait and see how the 7.5 fits first.<br/>This is the first thing I've ever returned, and I was surprised how easy and quick the process is. Aside from the size issue, I love the shoe. I haven't been able to find completely black newbalance shoes anywhere, and I like the material they are made of as well."
newbalance I have bought these shoes for many years but it seems like the last few years the quality has taken a nose dive. Whatever glue they are using is terrible! The sole starts to come away from the rest of the shoe within a few months. I don't know how many times I've had to crazy glue it back together. I'm sure they know about this problem but they haven't seemed to fix it.
newbalance Very comfortable shoes.  I struggle with constant foot pain and it is hard to find a shoe that is all day comfort.  My podiatrist recommended these shoes.  He said several of his patience have had good luck.  He was right!
"newbalance Love these sturdy, well-made shoes - and I'm so appreciative that they make wide sizes available; bought a 12.2E, and it fits so perfectly - no claustrophobic narrow, blister-inducing, cramped shoes here!"
newbalance They fit me perfectly. I have been using them for my tennis for the past week and they are amazingly comfortable. Even better than my last pair of newbalance shoes that I used them to replace.  Great value.
"newbalance I buy these shoes for my boyfriend every few months. He walks a lot, and really is hard on shoes. These are the single best pair of shoes he could own as far as comfort, and not leaving his feet sore after a long day. He loves them."
newbalance I live in a small town and would have to travel an hour to a NB store to purchase shoes. I know my size and the #NB shoe I wanted.<br/>Thanks Amazon! You are a lifeline to the larger world. The price was great as well.
newbalance I love newbalance shoes! They are the lightest shoes that I've ever worn and they really hold up well! I've been wearing newbalance shoes for over twenty years now and I will never wear another brand.
"newbalance Very poorly made, will never buy again, upon opening box and getting out shoes noticed the inside insole was not even in the shoes. I cannot wear the shoes no inside sole. Amazon cannot wear this shoe."
"newbalance I bought these for my dad, They are the only shoes he will buy for work. HE LOVES THEM! He has been buying the same shoe for YEARS, he works about 60-70 hours a week at least, all while wearing these shoes, His job is very physical and very demanding and these shoes hold together for him about a year sometimes more."
"newbalance These are a really good shoe at a great price!  newbalance as terrific removable insoles and great support.  I cannot say how they hold up for a runner, but for daily normal wear they are terrific."
"newbalance My highest rating is a 4* because I believe the highest and lowest ratings should be thrown out.<br/><br/>I've been wearing these sneakers for work and play every day for the last 4 years.  I've gone through 4 pairs in that time, and typically use my newer pair for work (I'm a retailer and am on my feet all day) while keeping my old pair for weekends and yard detail.  As far as durability goes, these are great.  I'm about as far from a runner as you'll find, however these work great for my daily routine of walking, crouching, kneeling, climbing, and generally moving through my day."
"newbalance newbalance shoes aren't as good as they were when they were made in the USA, but you still can't beat them on price. Also, they make my feet feel great. I've been wearing NB for the last 17 years."
newbalance Why is it that different manufacturers all seem to have their own sizing??  Is there not industrial standards?  So frustrating.  Apparently I am now a size 9 1/2 EE?? I am normally an 8 1/2 normal.
newbalance Wonderful shoe.  I have been wearing the same model for years.  These are a different color that I like much better and at a better price than I paid for my old ones.  This was my first time online purchase of shoes.  I figured I couldn't go wrong since they were shipped with Amazon Prime as I could return them if needed.  So far I'm really pleased with them and I will buy them again when mine wear out.  Thanks Amazon for selling my shoe.
"newbalance The pair I have is brown, unusual in my experience, and really nice!  They fit supremely well and are exceotionally comfortable. I am still amazed that I found them by surprise and couldn't be happier to own them."
newbalance As I get older my feet are much more sensitive and I think they are spreading out.  So I'm giving these a tryout as I exercise: a half size larger in length and next size the wider.  So far so good.
"newbalance These are the most comfortable shoes.  I know newbalance makes great shoes, but every day when I wear these, I am thankful for how comfortable they are.  I wear them 16-17 hours a day.  Love them."
"newbalance Been wearing this model newbalance shoe for years, so I knew what size I needed (9.5EEEE).  I wear a 10 in Nike Monarch's but newbalance I wear a 9.5.  Excellent shoe, great foot support.  Arrived on time and in perfect, new condition."
"newbalance I like the style, very comfortable, but the sole has a manufacturing defect with the glue. I have had 2 pairs, and both had the sole start separating from multiple points. I glued it back together, but after happening twice on shoes I bought a year apart, I don't know if I can buy them again, which sucks because I like the look of the brown ones (Which is why I re-purchased despite the sole defect)"
newbalance I have been wearing newbalance 608 shoes for years and am very happy they still make them. Great shoe if you have a very wide foot. I walk hundreds of miles in every pair before I buy the next and I have bought over 30 pair of these shoes.
"newbalance newbalance is the best shoe I have found for comfort and proper width for me. I use them for the gym, walking and casual wear. The only reason I rated this shoe as 4-star is the arch support. I suppose theirs is fine for most people but I use an insert recommended by my podiatrist because of my need for greater arch support. (If strong arch support is the primary concern, I would suggest you consider Merrell's for that).  I have 2 different styles of newbalance and love them both! Best improvement in recent months is the oval-Shaped shoestrings which stay tied without having to double-knot them! Thank you newbalance for that!"
"newbalance Had to change style of shoe I had been wearing because of discontinue.  This seemed to be similar and turned out to be an excellent replacement.  newbalance shoes are great for my active lifestyle, my feet do not hurt at the end of the day as with most other shoes."
"newbalance A well made shoe, durable, comfortable with extra wide/with 2E or W for Wide.<br/>This brand newbalance shoe have multiple option as to shoe with W 2E 3E wide.<br/>Perfect fit all the time."
newbalance These shoes fit the first time I put them on. I have wide feet and have a hard time finding shoes that fit properly. I also have heel pain when I have shoes that fit properly. Since wearing these shoes no heal pain. I work two jobs and am on my feet up to 13 hours a day. I have no heel pain at night or in the morning when I wake up. Can not say enough good things about these shoes
"newbalance They are cheaply made, but were on sale for just over $30, so what could I expect. They will do for the gym with good inserts. if you are looking for a sturdy shoe, look elsewhere. the ""memory foam"" inserts are kind of a joke."
"newbalance Shoes are a difficult item to review because it really takes a while to break them in and make sure they're doing what you want, etc. I'm a fairly big guy so I burn through shoes pretty quickly. I'm probably not qualified to write a great review of shoes, but I'll try.<br/><br/>Pros: Fits as expected (an 8.5EE is fairly rare, and more rare that one fits well), seem decently supportive<br/><br/>Cons: This is tough to describe, but generally when I get walking/hiking shoes, I can feel a ""spring"" in my step for the first week, what with all the cushioning usually in those types of shoes. With this one, I don't feel that. I'm not sure if this means it's NOT very supportive, or if it's just a subtle thing. It definitely feels like my feet are better supported w/these than my old, worn out ones, BUT I always really enjoy that ""new springiness."" We'll see how they feel in a month. I'll try to remember to update at that point."
"newbalance My husband is on his feet all day long, besides squatting and kneeling etc., and a few years ago he found these sneakers at a shoe store and knew right away these were the ones, he has never looked back. He wore his other pair out - literally. However to get him to go to a shoe store is like getting a child to eat their vegetables! So when I found these on Amazon, we entered the product number from the inside of his worn out sneakers and 'boom' there they were! I ordered them immediately. When we got them less than a week later and they fit him perfectly - my husband was thrilled! He was also tickled that he will never have to go into a shoe store again. Great Job! Thank You!"
"newbalance newbalance size 12.5 has always fit me before in at least four or five previous pairs of shoes. This pair my toes were hitting the end of the shoes. I also have a narrow foot and order them when newbalance offers them in the shoe I'm buying. This shoe wasn't offered in narrow width,so as I've done in the past I buy Dr sholls inserts that compensate for the too wide shoe. I didn't even get that far with this pair because they were too short. I exchanged the shoes for 1/2 size larger shoes and with Dr sholls inserts they are comfortable. The flat shoe laces are harder to tie and are way too long.."
"newbalance The quality of materials and build construction of these shoes is a little less than what I would expect from New Balnace, though over the years that has become true of more and more of their shoes.  I have very sore feet so no shoes are likely to give me all-day comfort but these do quite a good job of provide good support and comfort for normal wear.  I question how well they would stand up to hard use or heavy training.  The price I got them for was surprisingly low so I consider them an exceptional value.  I feel much better about ordering shoes on line when they have Prime shipping and free returns (within reason)."
"newbalance I have been buying these for years, and they always fit great. I liked version #1 the best, but have learned to accept change, I Just hope they never change the last for this particular shoe."
"newbalance I needed to buy solid black tennis shoes.  newbalance is my favorite brand and wasn't available in any of the local stores. Someone said it seemed risky to buy shoes online without trying them on first. But I have bought newbalance shoes for years and a size 9D always fits me perfectly. These shoes fit as well as always. I have to walk and stand all day on hard surfaces.  Although I have only worn them a couple of days they are comfortable enough even for a 10 hour shift.  I am a tall woman with larger feet to match. I have to wear men's shoes because women's shoes are not made in my size. A women's 10 is too small, an 11 is too large and unfortunately they don't make women's 10 1/2 shoes. But thank goodness the men's 9D works perfectly."
"newbalance Fit was a bit snug, but wearable. They did not have the rigid support in the back of the shoe, causing the back to collapse when you try to put it on. All my other newbalances have a plastic support in the heel."
"newbalance I love these shoes, I've been wearing them for years. They do get a little warm on my feet at the end of the day, but everything I've tried does the same thing, it gives me an excuse to kick them off at the end of the day!"
"newbalance I own another (older) pair of these shoes and both pairs are terrific for my cross training.  I usually do light running, walking, trips to the gym. Although the arch support is decent, try adding some ergonomic inserts if you need more support (for plantar fasciitis as an example).  My only complaint is the cheap, thin laces.  They cut in to the top of my foot--wish they were thicker.  If you have a narrower than average foot like I do, newbalance tends to be a little too wide, so you'll have to tighten up the laces to make them fit properly.  Overall though, a good shoe."
"newbalance I wasn't expecting much. I just wanted a cheap pair of good looking shoes, and I liked the look of these, so I bought them. Then I tried them.<br/><br/>These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn in my entire life. I had no idea it was possible to make a shoe this comfortable. It's like my foot is surrounded by pillows while walking on blankets. The bottom of the shoe changes shape as you walk which makes it even more comfortable. They are a little warm due to all the cushioning, but they're so insanely comfortable that it's worth it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for comfort, these are your shoes."
"newbalance Nice and comfortable but my feet moves around in them. I wouldn't call this an athletic shoe. Too stiff and bulky and does not fit tight enough. It is great for walking but not sports. I'll wear it till it wears out then I'll get something else. My fault for buying something unfamiliar on the internet. There is nothing wrong with this shoe. It is very comfortable. I just wouldn't recommend it as a ""training shoe""."
"newbalance I've always like newbalance. However, I was a little concerned since the width was advertised as 3E and I've always fit in 2E. When the shoes arrived, it had a 2E on the tag and fit just fine."
newbalance I have been wearing this shoe for 10 + years  (or a model just like it) and have never had an issue.  I wish they had 13.5 size but the 14 fit OK.  I actually like a slightly loose fit.
"newbalance Buying shoes online is a pain in the rear if you've never worn the brand before and don't know how it fits. I've been wearing NB trainers for a long time, so I know how they fit my feet and what size is right. I was pleased with the fit straight out of the box, and the shoes were comfortable for a workout the first time I wore them. They were equally comfortable when I wore them to work all day. I'm happy that NB continues to offer a solid black trainer, as I use them as travel shoes. Unless you're wearing a suit or formalwear, very few people pay much attention to men's shoes, so I can wear these with pretty much anything else while traveling overseas, both saving me packing space and weight, and making sure my feet stay comfortable. I hope these shoes last as long as my last pair did (5 years)."
"newbalance The 608 4E is very wide.  Best extra wide I've ever owned.  I only gave them 4 stars because they are very dark brown, nearly black.  The previous versions were a nice medium brown."
"newbalance Good shoes for walking fit just right, last pair lasted me over 3 years, would purchase these again if needed."
"newbalance Very good comfort and arch support. the only drawbacks are that newbalance has cheapened up on the materials of the shoe itself.  In addition, the soles of the shoes wear out much quicker than previous versions of the 608's.  I gave it 5 stars for comfort, for quality,  only 3.0.  Also, the cement used in the manufacture of the shoe gives way, the sole separated from the shoe after only 6 months of wearing.  I do like the memory foam inserts, comfy.  I've worn newbalance many years, however if the don't address the quality issues, I may consider a different brand next time."
"newbalance For my feet, these are extremely comfortable. Normally I need a lot of arch support. These feel great for me. 9-4E.<br/>I used these on a 2 week vacation, touring Japan. We were walking 10 to 14 hours each day and these felt great. A inch of stitching of the right shoe near the metatarsale fibulare came loose, so I easily sewed that up with one of those complementary small sewing kits in the hotel room. That fix seems permanent."
"newbalance My husband always has two pairs of newbalance Men's MX608V4 Training shoes.  He uses one for work and one for casual wear.  His work requires him to stand on concrete for long periods of time on some days, and this shoe provides the support he needs.  It also comes in 4E width that he needs, and is difficult to find in a good shoe.  He has been wearing the newbalance 608's for years because they provide the support, width, and comfort that he needs and enjoys wearing."
"newbalance I been a newbalance customer since the mid 80's after growing up wearing those old canvas converse sneakers yrs before...remember them?  I'll still call them sneakers no matter what their ""official"" designated name may be.<br/>First time ordering them online though but it worked out good. These replaced my worn out 608's.  Size fit perfect and the comfort is as expected. I'll order here again next time."
"newbalance Great fit, Comfortable even at work on concrete floor. Shoe laces stay tied. The removable shoe inserts are nice for awhile but need replacing within a month with something like Dr Scholl's inserts but expected that."
"newbalance Great shoes. I have unreasonably wide feet (4E), and it seems like newbalance is the only company that seems to understand how to make a truly wide shoes that fit well and are also good for athletic activities. I like these shoes quite a bit."
"newbalance Husband likes them, bought a second pair before he can't.  He also owns theNrw Balance 'hiker' in this color/style as well.<br/>These are nicely made.<br/>Wider width option."
"newbalance This is a great shoe, especially if you are prone to pronation (your ankles roll in).  newbalance is recommended by podiatrists for pronators- which is why I buy NB shoes.  I'm very pleased with these as they don't cut in at the toe, like some of the newer lasts do.  I like this last shape better.  The support is great- but I put an orthotic in as well, and the 4E gives me enough room to do that.  I am on my feet all day in these.  Love them."
newbalance Bought for husband as we have trouble finding a size 6.5 wide walking shoe. So there weren't many to choose from. The reviews seemed to be complimentary and I did see where a few stated they would be good for walking. He's worn them 3 times now and no complaints. He said they fit very well and they are very comfortable.
newbalance I noticed my last pair of NBs were snug up to the toe.  I took the dive and ordered a half size larger than I usually wear and these are spot on with lots of room for sport socks and a firm and secure fit.  First trip was a 4 mile hour on the tread mill with a good incline.  I could not ask for more and I promoted my old pair to yard work and spent 3 hours mowing the lawn in them.  Still lots of life there too after more than 3 years on the tread mill for many many miles.<br/><br/>I have long sought out NBs because they were made in the U.S.  This pair was not!  I did not think that they may be foreign made.  This may account for the small sizes and the decline quality other reviewers have observed.  My next pair may not be NBs after 30 years and many pairs.
newbalance Quality workmanship and well finished. The shoes are much lighter than I expected. but they fit well right out of the box and needed little or no break-in period. I use them for treadmill and light workouts. I would not recommend them for running or extended walking.
newbalance The only shoe that does not bother my plantar faciitis. Last version the sole separated. Hopefully this one will not have the same issue since the sole design is different.
"newbalance Comfortable, with lots of cushion and support for a person of size, without some of the support arches and ridges that many shoes have that end up pressing against a person's foot in the wrong spots. Love newbalance!"
"newbalance Haven't worn them much but the fit was very good, looking forward to it. Seemed good value for the price , must wear awhile to be sure. Great to have in what used to be obscure or forsaken sizes i.e. 4 E width.<br/><br/>Now that I have worn them (two pair, one brown, one black) I cannot say enough good about how these shoes feel.  I go to several trade fairs each year and have finally found the shoes that will carry me through the hikes from hall to hall and back again.  The quality of manufacturing starts out well and I hope I can report endurance when I order my next pair down the line."
newbalance I am going to try to put some shoe stretchers in the shoes to see if that help. They are just a tad short. I guess I will keep them  I have so much trouble sizing shoes.
newbalance Good shoes. Delivered as promised
newbalance I LIKE THEM A BIT WIDER THEN THE NORMAL SIZE.  THEN I JUST SLIP THEM ON WITH OUT ALL THE TYING.. YOU DO NEED A SHOE HORN OR A FINGER TO DO THAT :)<br/>THEY ARE NICE FOR WALKING
"newbalance I don't think these are size 10 us.ive been wearing this brand for ten years and these feel a little smaller than usual,but I think they will stretch.maybe newbalance has changed something.i don't know but they usually make a great shoe"
newbalance Just ordered my 4th pair. I walk any where from 6 to 8 miles a day every day. I went back and checked my orders. I've ordered a pair every 3 months. You can do the math.
newbalance My husband wears size 18. It is hard to find shoes that fit. These fit as expected. They wear down fast if you are wearing them everyday. The color is uglier in person than on here.
"newbalance Ordered the size I normally buy in the stores. As with any new shoes, feet got a little achy by end of day but that because my old pair are stretched  out. Pleased so far."
"newbalance These were too tight in the toe box for me even though I have the 608s VZ in a 9.5 and love them. The newer version hurt my Mortons Neuroma. I would have returned them, but didn't save the box. I ended up giving them to a friend. They also were not comfortable around the ankle. They look good on my friend's feet and have a nice style."
newbalance I love the shoes but they hurt my Achilles heals if I don't wear socks tall enough to cover it.<br/>The shoes look great and fit great and I would recommend buying them.
"newbalance I have very wide feet. (EEEE)  I find that the newbalance shoes consistently fit better than other brands that claim to be for wider feet.<br/><br/>I also like that they are made in the USA.  I know that's no longer important to many folks, but it makes a difference to me."
"newbalance I really like the shoe. There's just one problem...NB manufacturers their products with extreme cheapness. I've never been able to actually wear out a pair of NB's, the bottom part of the sole ALWAYS comes unglued before they are worn out. Which always leads me to check out other brands before buying another NB products."
"newbalance My husband fell ill last year. He can not feel much from the waist down. I really couldn't afford good shoes for him, but I got a few gift cards to Amazon. He needs to wear his shoes tight but the other sneakers kept breaking at the eyelets. The shoe comparison was amazing on what shoe size to get for these sneakers. I was able to get them for him for Christmas. He loves them! They fit great and he says they feel better on his feet. I would recommend them to anyone and using the shoe sizing tool on Amazon was great. I don't really like to buy shoes unless they are tried on first, but these fit great. Thank you for making a good Christmas present for him!"
"newbalance I am very unhappy with these sneakers and will be sending them back for a credit.  This is the third pair of NB ordered in the past two months.<br/>I've never had this problem, to this extent, with mail order shoes....that is over the past 25 years!<br/>I've only walked around in the house on carpeted floors and the shoes felt like the support insole was missing.<br/>Also, I ordered a half size larger that the largest shoe normally wear and my toes are at the max inside.  I also ordered EE width.  This feels somewhat improved from the normally worn  D width.<br/>Sorry, without the insole, I cannot recommend or wear these shoes."
"newbalance They are OK for the price. However, they are not of the quality(comfort, support) I get from my more expensive NB shoes. the bottom line, you get what you pay for."
"newbalance I've been wearing this newbalance training shoe for years, in white/navy and black.  It is the only shoe of it's type I've found that fits me perfectly and is amazingly comfortable.  I've tried similar Nike and Adidas shoes but they simply can't match the overall comfort.  It's all in the arch design and cushioning.  The 4E width is perfect for my feet.  Thanks newbalance!"
newbalance I bought a pair of these a couple of years ago from a local retailer and loved them. I have bad feet and these were the best I have worn. I've purchased several other brands and have always been a Hi-Tec man but their shoes have become inferior. I even tried some of the high priced options like Merrill and gave them away to my son.I ordered these a couple of days ago since my old ones are starting to show wear. Wearing the news ones today and they are just as comfortable as my old ones. Great job newbalance.
newbalance Comfortable shoes that should clean up pretty well each day after being an Umpire. Good price for a solid shoe. Wow! Amazon's one day delivery got it to me in less than 12 hours. How do they do it?
newbalance The 4E width is as wide as I expected and need for my feet.  Gray is nice color compromise that goes lots of my clothes.  Comfortable all day long for walking.
"newbalance This is my second pair of these shoes in black. The previous same model shoe I have purchased in blue. The only drawback is that the shoe laces are way to long and will need to be replaced. I bought 45"" replacement laces and changed them out. If they came with the 45"" laces I would give these shoes 5 stars."
newbalance The shoes are just like all of the other newbalance shoes I've purchased.  They are very comfortable and supportive.  I'll be buying them again in the future
"newbalance It appears that these ""608V4"" (Version 4?) have a little more room by my big toe.  In the older  original 608 shoes I have had a 1/2"" of toe seam break.  Other models before the original 608 were fine, and it appears that the 608V4 are also fine."
"newbalance My foot must have enlarged with age because I used to wear 12M and when I bought the 608 in the past it fit fine.  I bought a 608 recently and it was too narrow.  These in 12 2EE fit in terms of width.  Hope they last as long as the older shoes.<br/>I've now worn these shoes further.  I cannot continue to wear them.  Indonesia production to save material makes them too short.  My toes hit the front and and begin to hurt after a few minutes of walking.  It's probably too late to return them so I will have to give them away and lose ALL my money.<br/>Make sure you wear them inside your house for a while and if they don't fit, return them immediately."
newbalance newbalance shoes are just not as comfortable as they used to be but still the best fit I have found.  Just plan on purchasing some GOOD replacement insoles.
"newbalance This is a very comfortable shoe for me, and I have a wide foot.  I use these as everyday/all-day shoes and they work out great.  Good price/performance ratio."
newbalance my size fit great friend love the style and look this is not the 990 I used this for  my back up can' be the price and comfortable.<br/><br/>  great shoe
"newbalance These are my husband's favorite shoes. They are wide enough, even with inserts. He has been wearing them for years. Amazon has the best price and service."
"newbalance This is the first shoe that I have purchased that fit me Just Right. I took a chance by ordering a pair of shoes on line because it is so hard to find a shoe in the stores around that half way fits. I am glad that I took the chance.It seams in the past years the shoe sizes have changed. I used to ware 10 1/2 D in US size before the ones made from other countries started flooding the market.They did not offer a size that fit until now. I do wish that a pamplet would come with these shoes that told what the shoe was made of. Thank you , Sincerely, Bill"
newbalance I bought these for work and they are a life saver. My feet are really bad. I have bunions and flat feet and have a very hard time finding a comfortable shoe. These fit great and are very comfortable. Highly recommend.
"newbalance I waited a few weeks before writing my review to see how these shoes would break-in and perform over time, but these shoes are awesome. Extremely light weight and comfortable out of the box, and they get better with each run."
newbalance A little stiff first workout but feel great now. Just treadmill miles now but soon the weather will let me get outside. I am a walker now but want my running days back. Haven't had newbalance in a while and I am pleased with them.
"newbalance My husband loves these shoes.  Other shoes tend to break down on the outside, I guess because of the way he walks after bi-lateral knee replacements.  These tend to hold their shape a whole lot longer than other brands."
"newbalance Returned them. Zero arch support. Really disappointed, actually. I was looking for a more stylish alternative to NB 577s, which are fantastic walking shoes, but look like rounded, clunky black bricks. These are not it. If you need arch support, don't bother. I use Superfeet Green insoles, and even with them, this poorly-designed shoe provided no support whatsoever."
"newbalance These are just what you would expect from a newbalance shoe.  I wear these to work, which is business casual, and they look fine and are very comfortable.<br/><br/>I will buy these again (ok, this purchase was a repeat and I have bought them multiple times before... since they work well for what I need)."
"newbalance I have an ankle that has over 30 fracture lines, all the bones separated from the leg bone.<br/>As a result, I run over the heels of my shoes horribly. I searched extensively on Amazon<br/>and finally decided on newbalance because of the availability of a 2E width, broad heel and a reinforced<br/>heel counter. Long story short, to coin a phrase, I ordered them, arrived the next day, fit perfectly and now<br/>2 months later have by far exceeded  my expectations for wear, support and comfort."
"newbalance I purchased these newbalance shoes, because my previous newbalance shoes, have worn out, after a few years. They are so comfortable, durable and very nice looking! I don't need any other type or brand. I've tried other brands and just nothing has compared to these!<br/>  You can't go wrong with this purchase and there's no breaking in. Anyone would love these!"
"newbalance Husband loves these, it's his forth pair over the last few years, he uses them at work and walks all over the complex and they are always comfortable!!"
"newbalance Based on past experience, I knew the 608 was a great shoe. This was my first time ordering them online. There were no surprises at all. They fit and looked great."
newbalance These were for my husband - pretty close to the ones he purchased in a store about 4 years ago.  So he knew the brand and the fit and ordered accordingly.  They fit great!  He could probably wear them all day but is handicapped and can't stand all day.
"newbalance I Love these shoes!! I run the mail room so I am on my feet a big part of the day these shoes are so darn comfortable and look very cool too. I was worried at first because they are very well made not like a regular sneaker that is why I call them shoes. Not that newbalance sneakers are not made well but these are different when you see them you will know why I say that.... they look more like a shoe. Anyway you cannot go wrong with these they look good, feel good and the price is reasonable."
newbalance newbalance makes a great shoe. Wish they still made the old 608 itself instead of the V shoe. The V shoe doesn't fit and feel as good as the old 608/
"newbalance I've worn newbalance for almost 40 years. I hope the pair I received were an anomoly. The shoes started to fall apart on the third day of wearing...indoors!<br/>I have opted to have them replaced to see if it's just a bad pair.<br/>UPDATE: these shoes are awful. I hate them, that are uncomfortable, and make noise when I walk, and I would love to return them. newbalance has turned to crap. Amazon please help me. I want to return these shoes."
"newbalance My husband wears these shoes for work and it's hard to find a size 15 4E in stores.  I can always rely on this to be here, I've ordered many of these."
"newbalance I tried the newbalance Men's MX608V4 and found the Nike Air Monarch IV to be a far better shoe, although it is a little more money.  Relative to the Nike, the newbalance has a very stiff sole and feels and looks like a really cheap shoe.  The sole of the newbalance was so stiff that my knees were hurting just trying the shoe out around the house.  I've been wearing the Air Monarch for years and after a few minutes with the newbalance I decided to go back to the Air Monarch.  The Air Monarch is very comfortable and is a great shoe for tennis."
newbalance lengthwise these seem to run just a little bit smaller than normal. Otherwise great shoe and very comfortable. I would think about a half size larger.
newbalance I wear them daily for about two years before they start to fade. On my third set now. They are more comfortable than other brands that I have tried.
newbalance dependable
newbalance GREAT
"newbalance Wear and fit well; however, did not receive the shoes I ordered and expected. I order the 626. Shoes are fine. Company from which I ordered is doubtful"
"newbalance Due to foot problems I am very selective about my shoes.  I go through several returns each time I shop for a new pair because you never really know how a shoe will fit until you try it on.  This shoe lived up to it 4.5 star review.  The fit is as expected, it looks great, there is plenty of support, and it is built ruggedly enough for winter and rainy walks.  I did have to replace the insoles immediately because they were too thin but i suspect that will not be the case for the average buyer."
"newbalance Great to have v4 after v3 disappeared so long ago! I am completely satisfied. Great price; prompt delivery, as stated. Will purchase here again as needed."
"newbalance My husband loves these newbalance shoes, orders them all the time.  Not a very trendy design, but a comfortable, supportive shoe with good traction."
"newbalance Given my wide feet, NB is one of the few options available to me. At least these have been a consistent fit throughout their lines (mostly).<br/>This pair in particular fits as expected and is holding up well enough for daily work-week use. They're eventually fall apart, likely inside 2017, but I've been pretty hard on them."
"newbalance Great shoes for walking and moderate running. I run about three times a week, 2 or 3 miles each time. This shoes suit my purposes and great price."
newbalance I got the newbalance Men's shoe for my Husband. It fits him perfectly  and he still likes the brown color. He exercises as well as rides the Harley with them!
"newbalance I haven't worn these sneakers yet, so I can't speak to how they'll last or wear.  However,  I can tell you how they fit.. I've been a perfect size 12 medium in all newbalance sneaks for as long as I can remember.  When I ordered the 12 in this model, they were WAY too tight.  They were crushing my toes in the front.. I went back and read some past reviews and others has the same experience..  I returned the 12 and ordered a 12 and a half.  The half size made a big difference and now they fit perfectly."
newbalance Seller allowed me to exchange for 1/2 size larger - Excellent fit - very comfortable. To be used solely for exercise in gym (no street wear) - should hold up over long haul. Shoes appear to be sturdily built - so they should not fall apart as some other reviewers mentioned. The laces issue is normal (probably have to be replaced every year or so). The cushioning provided is very easy on feet - one might replace with 3rd party inserts to get a really soft feel. Overall would recommend these shoes as good value for the money. Might want to consider getting 1/2 size larger than your normal size as they run a little short/narrow (at least for my foot). Also excellent service from the seller.
"newbalance I've worn newbalance 608 in several versions for many years. These have the comfort sole insert and are great for walking, biking, working out, all the things I do regularly. My only concern is that 608s may not be around much longer. Hard to find locally. GO AMAZON!"
newbalance Very comfortable.  I've worn them for two days on my feet (as in standing and walking) without the usual achy feet from adjusting to new shoes.
"newbalance The shoes fit a touch small, but not using them for running, they seem to be fine. He always wears a size 12 and theseseem a touch smaller than a size 12."
newbalance Love newbalance shoes because I have very wide feet and they are one of the few manufacturers that offer 4e widths with a wide choice of styles and colors. I was a bit worried about buying shoes online but since I have owned this brand and model more than a few times I took a chance and as always NB didn't disappoint. Excellent product.
"newbalance This is a re-order of the same shoe I ordered several years ago. My podiatrist recommends newbalance, so what better reason is there than that?"
"newbalance Runs very large, had to go down 1 1/2 sizes to get to normal. The inner liners are removable. They are hard to grasp, but grabbing at the insole they can be removed. They are not glued or attached in anyway. The bottom of the shoe has a blue rubber texture. The insole that come with the shoe are very hard, very thin and stiff about 1/8th inch and do not give at all. I highly recommend you buy a set of third party insoles that can be cut to the pattern of the insoles you remove."
newbalance This particular NB shoe has a larger toe than competitive shoes &amp; other NB shoes. I purchased different NB shoes &amp; returned to the 608 style shoe for the comfort.
newbalance Edit: Got the regular width this time and they're perfect.  As a postal worker that is on his feet ten hours a day six days a week these are the best shoes I've found yet.  And the price is right.  And if they lasted me six months then they would last someone who doesn't abuse his or her shoes even longer.<br/><br/>These are my first pair of newbalance shoes.  Ordered the wide because I didn't know how they would fit and other brands have been too narrow.  Turns out the wide was too wide and should have gone with the standard medium width.  Lesson learned.  Good news is I love the shoes and will buy again.  As a letter carrier I'm on my feet all day and these are great shoes.  Would recommend to my coworkers.
"newbalance These shoes are clearly at the lower end of newbalance's product offerings. I purchased the size 16, a size up from my normal 15 and was surprised that they were smaller than several older pairs of newbalance size 15s I already own. They will be ok for what I want them for, which is to wear during exercise, but I wouldn't have been able to wear a size 15 in this model at all. Also, the sole insert is flat, and I mean ""flat"". It has no discernible arch at all. I substituted a premium replacement insole, which solved the support problem and also helped with the overall length problem by pushing up my arch, effectively ""shortening"" my foot."
"newbalance Memory Foam insoles are quite comfortable...Initially, they fit a tad snugly...after four or five wears they are more comfortable.  But next time I'll order a 1/2-size up."
newbalance My first pair of these shoes is starting to wear out so it's time for a new pair.  These shoes fit great and are very comfortable walking shoes.
"newbalance This particular model shoe, was recommended by my foot doctor as having the proper support for good foot health. I was wearing Sketchers before, but suffered from, Plantar's Facia. The newbalance shoes do not seem to aggravate that condition.They are comfortable and fit well. They do however, have a short life. The last 4 pair, only lasted a year each, before the soles parted from the uppers. It's a great shoe but the workmanship could be a lot better. It would help if they were a bit cheaper, considering that they don't seem to hold up as long as they should."
"newbalance I love these shoes because they fit my 4E feet perfectly and are made and wear very well.  I have bought numerous pairs over the years and use them for aerobic workouts, weight training, walking and casual outings."
"newbalance I can not give these shoes an informed evaluation, other than the fact that they were too small for me to wear! Since I am required to provide a ""star"" rating, I have given them 4 stars!<br/><br/>I have been wearing newbalance  608's in one version or another, in size 13 4E, for more years than I can remember. They have always been a very comfortable fit from the start. These however were quite tight and seem to be a bit shorter than the older pair I have been wearing. They also seem to be a lot lighter in weight. I ordered one pair in white/navy and another in the brown. I am returning them both and ordering another pair of each in size 14 4E. Hopefully those will fit more comfortably?"
"newbalance I purchased these to replace my existing newbalance shoes which were starting to wear out. I compared the model/size/everything to the tag on my current shoes and ordered what I hoped was the exact same shoe I had before. Unfortunately, these were much smaller in the toe width and a big larger in the length than my previous shoes. Apparently size 10 1/2 changes over time for a company. They are still comfortable enough to wear as is but I will probably not be buying another pair of these shoes when I these current ones wear out."
newbalance newbalance sneakers have been good to me...  untill now. MX208v4 are worse than WallyWorld 10 dollar sneakers. these sorry low grade money grubbing onlt lunk
newbalance Love it.
newbalance I've wore this model shoe from newbalance for the past year or two and they are by far the most comfortable to wear of all the premium brands.<br/>I very highly recommend this shoe.
newbalance Love the memory foam insole! I wore them for 2 months exclusively at the gym. 40 minute workouts. Feet stay comfortable. Would recommend
newbalance they fit very well but the problem is that they wear out fast on the inside the memory foam does not hold up well i am hard on sneakers but i have never wore out the inside before the outside very disappointed with thees for the price
"newbalance I tried another brand after I couldn't find NB at local stores.  Big mistake.  Came on Amazon and order a few pairs and once again love my shoes.  I wasn't sure on the 2x or 4x wide so defaulted to the 4x and very glad I did.  An incredibly comfortable fit.  The 2x may have worked too but if you're looking for a ""wide"" shoe I'd try the 4x first.  Those seem to fit like the ones I used to buy from the local store.  Anyways a very good product as usual.  Thanks!"
newbalance Comfortable and fit well but extremely squeaky!!
newbalance You get exactly what you expect from newbalance. I bought these in the 10.5 4E since they didnt have 2E in my size. Little wider then i want but still very comfortable. I stand and walk for 10 hrs a day for work and bought these for comfort for a long day on my feet and they do the job great.<br/><br/>Only downfall is they was out of the color I really liked guess it got (discontinued.)<br/><br/>Overall I highly recommend for anyone who walks or stands alot everyday.
newbalance Great shoes.  I add PowerStep inserts to give me additional arch support.  I like these because you can get wide sizes.
"newbalance Good Shoe. Have been buying for years.  Fits as expected and is good quality - not great, but good.  Wear them for workouts and for around the house."
newbalance Kind of odd.  I originally ordered a size 12.5 Wide.  They were too small.  My Toe was cramped and were uncomfortable.  Therefore I returned them and ordered a size 13 Wide.  These are too big.  Whodathunkit?  I won't be ordering these shoes again.  I'll go back to Nike.
"newbalance This shoe are very comfortable, I bought two pair...just in case I can't find them when the pair wears out.  My orthotics fit very nicely in the show also."
newbalance I normaly wear newbalance size 13 2E but ordered 13 4E.  They took ten days just to ship and arrived two days later.  Tried them on and are 1/2 small.  Thinking of sending them back
newbalance Every time I order newbalance shoes I am very happy with them. I have nothing else to say. These shoes are great. Does not even require a breakin period.
"newbalance I buy these shoes for my brother, who we've always had trouble finding shoes to fit ever since he hit puberty. Plus the prise is great! The shoes lasted him 9 months last time and he's not very gentle with his foot wear."
"newbalance I have been buying the 608's for the better part of the last 15 years and this is pretty much the same shoe I've been comfortable with for all that time.  I might try going to the 6E (which wasn't available in the way back when for my last 7 or 8 pairs) because I haven't tried that and I've felt that they might be just a tad too snug (though not uncomfortable).<br/><br/>By the bye, the 623's served their purpose, but were doomed by overuse and poorer arch support than I had come to expect from newbalance (then again, the 608's might've spoiled me and I have fairly high arches to begin with)"
"newbalance I love these shoes! As someone with wide feet it's hard to find any shoes at any local retailer that will fit and be comfortable. Once I found newbalance that has changed. I am on my feet all day long and newbalance has me covered for work and play. I should be wearing a 5E, but the newbalance 4E MX608V4 fit perfectly. I would like to see some alternate styles in the future, but for now these are comfy enough.<br/><br/>I have found that this style of Training Shoe will last me around 8-9 months of use before they become too loose &amp; worn. With a price point at around $50 it's well worth it, and with Amazon's return policy it's a no brainer to order these online. I will be buying again."
"newbalance For more than 10 years I make ""blind"" purchase on NB running shoes and so far no disappointment TKS NB you1re the best!"
newbalance I wear newbalance because they are the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn.  My feet use to hurt but sense I started wearing these shoes they hurt no more..
"newbalance The first pair ordered of this exact shoe from another source was to short.  I then ordered this pair of the exact same show model from this source and they fit fine, are very comfortable and very satisfactory.  Both pairs were made in Indonesia.  Why the difference?"
newbalance Bought these for my Brother in law he needed shoes for work right away.  We ordered on Sunday he got them on Monday he was thrilled uses them for work so he is tough on shoes.
"newbalance My old 609's finally wore out.  Used shoe goo for last couple of years to keep them going.  Bought 608's and they fit great, look great and feel great.  Have walked several miles in them in last two weeks with no break in time.  No blisters or sore feet.  They are great for me"
"newbalance Long lasting and very comfortable. I wear orthotics in my shoes, but this shoe gives me enough support that I don't need the orthotics. The laces are very long, even for my 15 EEEE wide foot so I have to double loop when tieing to prevent dragging laces...but not complaining because other shoes have too short lacing. I also bought these in white."
"newbalance This brand and model of shoe fits me perfect and is very comfortable.<br/>When I need casual shoes, these are the ones I go for."
"newbalance newbalance shoes were recommended by my Podiatrist because the inserts come out easily.  I have flat feet and wear orthotics since most shoes do not give me adequate support.  I used to wear Nike but the inserts are usually glued in and hard to get out.  After trying newbalance, I liked them and stuck with them.  I like the fact that they also make some shoes in America although those are almost twice as expensive.  They are the only company left that makes any tennis shoes in the USA."
newbalance newbalance has always been my choice of purchase.  They always have that comfortable feeling that comes with a perfect fit.
"newbalance Great shoe, fits perfectly. The only  athletic shoe I wear is newbalance, as it provides adequate room for my wide, flat feet."
newbalance Love the 608s !  Great support for my flat feet and super comfortable!
"newbalance My son's eye rolls notwithstanding, I like the old school newbalance.  These are quite comfortable and everything I need in a sneaker I'll wear a lot.  Great fit, and support, even better than previous versions.  Appreciate the available 2E.  For the price, an excellent buy.  ADDENDUM:  Liked the white/navy ones so much I ordered the red/grey.  Unfortunately, although the size is identical (8.5 2e), the shoe is not.  The red/grey ones are really cramped in the toe box.  Had to return them.  SECOND ADDENDUM.  Thought I'd just get a second pair in white/navy -- and they are now quite short.  I wear their sneakers all the time, but newbalance really needs to work on its consistency in its sizing."
"newbalance I've always bought newbalance because I can find them in wide width (4E).  I was a bit disappointed when I went to order this time because I wanted to replace my last pair of sneakers with the exact same item but they seem to have changed slightly.  This was the closest I could find to what I had before.  These seem comfy at first, but I do find my feet ache a little after having them on for a full day.  I'm not sure yet if it's the different model or just that I spent more time on my feet."
"newbalance newbalance is my favorite athletic shoe and I've never been unhappy with the fit, look &amp; how sturdy they are. Great shoes."
newbalance Good quality shoe. What I have come to expect from newbalance. Use it for everyday footwear as well as working out at the gym
"newbalance Very comfortable shoes. I work in retail 5 days a week, 10 hours per shift.. and I have to say these shoes are the most comfortable I've found in a while. I'm just now reordering a pair after a year, I ended up tearing one up pretty well. I did notice the sole started tearing off from the front, but that's due to the wear and tear I put on them. The bottom line is I can walk all day long on these and not even think about foot pain. And in the few days I've been different shoes as I wait for my newbalances pair to arrive... I really can feel the burn after a few hours."
"newbalance the shoe runs small so I ordered a half size up, it will be fine after the shoe gets broken in. The shoe itself is very nice and I like the appearance."
newbalance The 608 is the only wide width training shoe that will fit my husbands foot! He has been wearing them for at least the last 10 years and refuses to wear anything else!
newbalance Great shoe. I had purchased another style that was the same size but did not fit. This one fits perfect. No squished toes :-)
"newbalance bought these for my son as he is on his feet and walking all day... his old shoes were hurting the balls of his feet - and the only thing that didn't hurt  was his trainers... so we found these and hoped they would be cushioned enough, while giving somewhat of an illusion of a dress shoe - or at least a biz casual look that he could wear in the office... and VOILA!  These seemed to have been the perfect solution!"
newbalance I am so happy with these shoes.  The fit is perfect and they are ideal for long walks or standing on your feet for extended periods of time.
newbalance At first I thought they were too small.  Forgot to take the toe stuffing out.  Been in Alabama too long.  Going stupid.
"newbalance I bought it for our guest from Russia and he loves it from the first moment. He wears it everyday for running, walking and feels very comfortable."
newbalance needed a wider shoe so this is my first 4E and it does give me the room I need; seems to be the right size and comfortable and good price
newbalance Excellent shoe. My feet hurt so bad I could hardly walk. After wearing these shoes I can even run again. I have 3 pair.
"newbalance Once again, newbalance has changed their widths between orders/years.  These people have no standards that you can count on."
newbalance Very comfortable sneakers. Price was the best we have found for this product. I've been very happy with newbalance for years and this product did not disappoint.
"newbalance My husband loves these sneakers, especially that they do not look sneakerish!<br/>And he was able to do walking tours with them and remain comfortable"
"newbalance I've been wearing 608 series for a long time. I walk 2000 miles a year and have found each series at least as good as the last. The last 608v3 I got over 1400 miles of walking before retired for the new v4. So far the v4 I have had for 100 miles and they are comfortable and I see no wear to speak of. I think these will outlast the v3 and are just as good. The only thing I noticed that in any way detracts from these shoes is the heel area on the v3 and prior was more or less angled towards the rear, where these are more or less angled towards the front, so if you have long leg jeans on that are a little too long, they have more of a tendancy to want to go under the heal."
newbalance Very comfortable. This is the first time I have purchased newbalance Shoes and and they seem well made. I like them.
"newbalance These shoe's represent an excellent deal for big men.  They are comfortable, look good and are relatively inexpensive, as good jogging/walking shoes go.  I highly recommend them for the Big &amp; Tall set looking for great athletic shoes.  They are shipped free from Amazon, quite an extra savings for big shoes."
"newbalance Toe box and front of shoe are narrower than I recall NB shoes to be. Not quite bad enough to return, but disappointing."
newbalance Surprisingly comfortable sole. The sole is a bit stiff so hoping it gets more flexible with some use. Great support.
newbalance The gift recipient liked the shoes immediately. He said they were comfortable from the start and he likes the looks.
"newbalance newbalance is only shoe that comes in wide<br/>Sizes: 4E+. I consistently find their shoes to be comfortable and long wearing. And, they look good!"
newbalance 2 stars only. The shoes fit perfectly.  But the sole is about 1/8 of an inch.  It will wear out soon.  Cheap quality.
newbalance These shoes fit and wore great ... for a few months. Then one of the shoes started to tear apart from the sole by the toe. I only used the shoes moderately and so was very disappointed with its short life span and poor quality. Would not buy again.
newbalance I wear an eleven and a half but ordered these at twelve and a half and the fit is very good. you will probably need to order yours at least a half to one full size larger to get the fit you want. The shoe is a little heavy but very comfortable.
newbalance I am very happy to buy this product.<br/>The shipment was very fast and arrived in very good condition.<br/>Thank you.
newbalance Shoes fit well. The 2E was slightly wider than D and was less than 4E.  The shoe was snug but it should relax some.
"newbalance I like these shoes. They fit well, after I increased my size by 0.5, and are comfortable. I had previously used a slightly different newbalance shoe at the 11 4E size so I ordered the same size with these. My toes went right to the front of the shoe so I returned them and ordered an 11.5 4E as a replacement and it now fits great. My previous shoe, which I had purchased twice, had switched to a new version number which was getting poor reviews otherwise I probably would have stuck with it. These are great so far except that there isn't a strong arch support. Still, they are comfortable and I am happy with my purchase"
"newbalance They fit just right, my last pair were to wide and my foot felt like it was always loose no matter how tight I puled on the strings. These are definitely as the little bear put it Just Right."
"newbalance While these shoes are not quite the same as my 609's which I have loved and are apparently no longer made, they are comparable. There is a few days break-in period, but they are very comfortable. The slight difference may be in the suede material which the blue ones I got are made of versus the traditional white variety, but I love them just the same. I wanted something that I could wear with shorts when not wearing my sandals, but would also look good with casual pants. Very pleased so far."
"newbalance My NB's are great.I've never bought sneakers,shoes,boots,etc.,online because I was worried about getting the right size.No problem here.Fits perfectly."
newbalance These NB shoes are decent but not the best I have had from this brand. The insoles feel strange and not 100% comfortable - I might need to get used to this feeling. The fit is alright and the arch support is minimal. I will not return it since I wore it but I will not purchase again.
"newbalance Just the quality I expect from newbalance. Fit well, constructed well, great for the gym and casual around town."
newbalance My husband has always been 100% pleased with newbalance. He has been wearing them for years. Will buy them again.
"newbalance Pretty comfortable, not quite as comfortable as the other newbalance I have owned, but good value for the price."
newbalance About my 4th pair over the years. They rotate from every day to yard work to trash over 3 years. Some reviews say they are changing. I feel like they meet my expectation.
"newbalance We purchased these shoes, because they allow enough room for the insertion of orthotics, without cramping the foot."
newbalance A perfect fit in line with other newbalance shoes. It is a very nice shoe for $55. I am very happy with this shoe.
"newbalance I got these for work because I do inspections, out in the elements, up and down stairs, going to rooftops, basements etc.  I was looking for something sturdy and comfortable that could handle a little rain and snow with a good grip.  These shoes are really comfortable and it feels like you're walking on a cloud so they are great, the only problem is they run a little big.  But, I didn't wanna send them back. I just put on a couple of extra pairs of socks.  It's cold any way so that works fine. I don't think I'll be able to use these in the summer though.."
"newbalance I used to run quite a lot and newbalance was my choice because of good cushioning, low weight, sturdy construction, an longevity. Now I walk rather than run but NB is still my choice. Reliable fit, very comfortable, and still look well made altho not exclusively in the USA."
"newbalance 2nd pair of these for me, very comfortable. NB's seem a little wider than Nike's and fit my wide hoofs better."
newbalance Based on a recommendation from my podiatrist I have been wearing newbalance shoes for a few years.  Additionally my podiatrist instructed me to remove the standard insoles and use newbalance insoles.  The comfort is amazing!
newbalance I am a letter carrier and like these shoes because they are wide.  I have had a couple foot surgeries and need the extra width.  I can wear these comfortably with no break-in needed.  They will go 3 or 4 months at the most and then the glue that holds the toe piece on begins to let go and that is about all she wrote.  Of course that is around 800 miles of walking before they are worn out.  The shoe strings tend to stretch and become really long after a while.
"newbalance Its a shame that NB had to ruin a great line of shoes - been wearing the 608's for as long as I can remember, always the same 13-4E's, always the same great fit and comfort.  The new pair arrived today and only had to slip them on for 30 seconds to know that something changed - my big toe was crushed just putting on the shoe.  Standing up made it worse... I was able to stand just long enough to notice that the foot-bed was uncomfortably uneven non-supportive with practically zero arch support.  These sucker are going back in the morning."
"newbalance we bought these for my father. he is on oxygen and has limited mobility, and these gave him a solid footing."
"newbalance Perfect fit for a hard to buy for man with extra wide feet.<br/>He said ""I like them""<br/>Needless to say I jotted a note on that day in the calendar"
"newbalance I LOVE these shoes! I've been wearing this same brand and style for probably 10 years now, and can see no reason to change. They fit great, and they make my feet feel fantastic. They last a really long time too. I wear the same pair day in and day out, and my last pair lasted almost a year. I'm a big guy, and that says a lot about the quality. Sure you can spend $150 on Nike's,, but why WOULD you when you could almost get three pairs of newbalance for the same price!<br/>Buy them! Buy them today!"
newbalance My Second Pair Very Comfortable I wear them for Everything Cause All Black I have to get Shorter Shoe Laces Cause I step on Them And they Untie
newbalance Perfect!! My friend was so happy. He says they're just right !! He says thank you so much!!<br/><br/>I thank you
newbalance Shoes were a good middle range quality of materials with a nice look to them. One shoe had an insert that was about 1/4 inch too long to lie flat in the shoe. It needed to be trimmed in order to fit it in.
newbalance Very comfortable shoes that hold up well.  It's like putting on a custom made shoe it fits so comfortably.
"newbalance I bought these shoes for my husband who has worn this brand and model for years. He has wide feet and needs comfortable shoes that don't bother his plantar fasciatis. (Painfully inflamed tissue on bottom of foot). Most shoes will bother him after an hour or so, but he can wear these all day long. To quote him: ""It feels like I am walking on air."" As I said, he uses them every day for many hours and he usually gets about 2 years out of them."
"newbalance These shoes fit as expected!<br/><br/>They are quite comfortable, and well made.<br/><br/>I am very happy with my purchase."
newbalance Very nice shoe that fits me perfectly....exactly what I was looking for. I like the color and the material. I had to purchase some shoestrings separately because the ones that come with the shoe are way too long.
newbalance been wearing this style of sneaker for year  they are comfortable and wide  and amazon usually have the best price.
newbalance Most confortable shoes I have.  I Take them to work daily.  Third pair I purchased.  Greatly recommend them if you have feet tiredness
"newbalance My husband liked his old ones just like these.  He wore them out!  He doesn't like a lot of shoes, so I bought another pair of these."
"newbalance Nice shoe, needs to be worn a few more times to few more comfortable.Well built and a reasonable price."
"newbalance I bought these for my father, and he loves them. They are light enough to be comfortable, but sturdy enough to provide him the support he needs. They also look great with his casual pants and jeans."
newbalance My husband loves these shoes and has just about worn them out.  He was pleased with the comfort and color.
newbalance I've been buying newbalance shoes for a long time and have never been disappointed. These shoes are no exception! They fit perfectly and are very durable. I have wide feet and they are always comfortable from the moment you put them on. I am rough on shoes and they have usually lasted 5 years or more. Don't hesitate! Buy these shoes!
"newbalance Very Disappointing, I bought these for my husband.  I have purchased this exact same shoe on 3 previous occasions over the last 10 years.  This pair are notably smaller and simply not as well made.  My husband has a prosthetic lift added to them when we buy them, so returning is not an option.  I guess my days of newbalance are over."
newbalance Loved the shoe. It was a little tight fitting. It was the size I wear but should of ordered a 1/2 size bigger had I known.
newbalance These were a gift to a family member and they fit well and are very comfortable.  I will order again.
newbalance I wear them every day so it's hard to say if they wear out over a year or if I wear them out. I have purchased 4 pairs of this same or similar show over the years because I really like how it fits. Great for wide feet
"newbalance Have been buying newbalance for 20 years. The last few pairs have problems with sole separation. This latest pair separated after only 5 months. Purchased same model Aug, 2015, and lasted 7 months with rest of shoe in reasonably good condition considering daily wear. Will try to repair with shoe glue. Will also buy a different brand after over 20 years!"
"newbalance Good, comfortable, well made and fit is great.  Own more than one pair of newbalance running shoes."
"newbalance I have been buying 608's for a long time, this one is different. It has a memory foam insole, no arch at all. Somehow it has the same product number as other MX608V4's but is not the same shoe. It is a different shoe. Not happy will likely return it."
"newbalance Order arrived on time,I bought them for work because I'm on my feet Eight To ten hours a day,I need comfort which they were  at first but after wearing them about two months my feet started to hurt and by the forth month I couldn't take it anymore.so  my wife bought a different type by newbalance what a difference."
"newbalance Love these, they are the only ones I buy.  They wear out in about 4 months but they are worn everyday."
"newbalance The toe box is a tad larger than the other NB sneakers I normally buy but all in all, it's OK and it looks nice in the grey color"
newbalance These are the only shoes my husband can order on line and ALWAYS know that the fit will be perfect.
newbalance They are nice looking shoes and the fit is right. They could use a little more cushion in the heel.
newbalance Super product.<br/>Just what I needed.<br/>Seem to be a great product.<br/>Highly recommended!!!
newbalance I use these as both my work shoe and for exercise. They are very comfortable and I will likely buy more of the same or as close to the same as I can get when it's time to replace them.<br/>Confirmed - 1 year later I've bought another pair.
newbalance newbalance shoes are great shoes. I have never had any issues with them in all the years I have purchased them. These fit greaandt  look good but wow do my feet stick from these shoes. Not sure what the deal is but I can't stand to be in the same room with my feet after I take the shoes off. Even after the socks are off and put away my feet still stink to high heavens. What are these shoes being made of these days? Will have to buy different shoes from now on I guess.
"newbalance Its so hard to find shoes for my son's wide feet. These are super cushioned and very comfy, plus they look good!"
"newbalance Great shoes and I got a great deal on them as well.  I have a flat foot so I don't need an arch support, and the memory foam insoles are an upgrade over many of the basic newbalance shoes.  I have a wide foot and newbalance has been one of my main brands for years and so far these are some of the best I've had, including some of the higher ends shoes."
newbalance Husband loves these shores.  This is the third pair he has purchased.  They are quite comfortable.
newbalance I've been buying essentially the same shoe for more than a decade. This one was no disappointment.
"newbalance Been wearing these since V 1 times.  One of the few cross trainers available in size 16.  Fit well, comfortable and long wearing.  Amazon prices are competitive and Prime delivery is great"
"newbalance Have worn these shoes for years. First time ordering them from Amazon. No surprises, great shoe that fits."
"newbalance The fit was a little small. Therefore, I sent them back and ordered the 623 in the same color and the fit is just right."
newbalance I have bought these shoes many times and they are perfect fit and my feet are always comfortable.
"newbalance I picked the navy colored suede shoe.  Nice looking.  I wear a size 14. They run about half a size small but still feel comfortable enough. There are times a tighter fitting shoe is better so I kept them.  This is my third pair of newbalance shoes I have purchased recently, two pair fit as expected and these run smaller.  You would think a huge shoe company like newbalance would be consistent within there own line."
newbalance Finally got to try these on. I used the provided size chart and these fit like a glove. Very pleased.
"newbalance out of the box, on my feet,yes,success----- I did buy an extra wide for this shoe, a 2ee and yes"
"newbalance I wear a size 12 and this shoe was too short, which is a shame because I have pairs of newbalance that fit just fine."
"newbalance My feet probably fit best in a 13.5 size, but I always go for 14. I bought these last week to wear at work where things are less casual. I didn't try them without first removing the original insoles. Luckily the laces aren't unnecessarily long. The shoes are great - much better than I was expecting. A few years down the road I may by another pair."
"newbalance I wear these quite a lot, hence the ""knock-around"" label. They see moderate gym use, but they're mostly for street wear.<br/>About what you should expect from a moderately priced shoe. These are my second pair of newbalance training shoes; probably a different model number, but almost identical in style. The others were about a quarter inch wider and comfortable. Suspect these will stretch out and be okay.  The insoles are not of the highest quality, so you'll probably want to trade them out for after market."
newbalance I've worn newbalance shoes for years and this pair meets my expectations. Not the greatest shoes I ever put on my feet but quite adequate especially for the price.
"newbalance LIKE ALL MY NB SHOES,FIT WELL,BUT THE SUPPORT IS NOT LIKE  ALL THE OTHERS,I AM SATISFIED THOUGH"
newbalance Exactly what I had hoped for - a good fit. The price was reasonable and delivery was (Prime) two days. What's not to like?
newbalance Fits perfectly. I have always enjoyed newbalance. I reorder the same pair.
"newbalance This is to review both the shoes and Amazon's ""Fit"" tool! The shoes fit very well and are comfortable for all day wear at my job. Being cross-trainers means they have more padding than walking shoes, which turns out to be very good indeed for all day wear! And the new ""fit tool"" that Amazon has, also worked perfectly to get the right size. I plugged in my info from my old newbalance walking shoes, and it suggested that I should get a half size larger and the 4E width. Perfect fit! This tool is a brilliant idea!"
newbalance Thought they would stretch a little but after wearing for a short period still too tight.  should have ordered a wider size.
"newbalance <div class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"" id=""video-block-R1HUUV6Z4YWNZR""></div><input class=""video-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1dRv2kwN1S.mp4""/><input class=""video-slate-img-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810jNUwR57S.png""/>¬†It took my Husband a long time to find shoes that worked for him.  He went through a lot of shoes and some of them were other styles in the newbalance.  The 608 V4 seem to be the only ones he can wear and wear all day.  One thing he does as soon as he gets any shoe is take their arch support out and put in his own that he had special made.  I can't take any stars off because of him throwing the arch support away because no arch support works for him except the one he had made just for his feet.<br/><br/>You may think since he has a special arch that he could wear any shoe that comes along.  He can't!  Some shoes tilt him a different way and they just don't feel comfortable to him.  This is the only brand and style he wears.<br/>It cost us a lot of money to figure out that he needs to stick to this shoe.  We tried all kinds of brands and even the other styles in NB don't seem to work.  So, he keeps buying this style and size and that seems to work out great for him.<br/><br/>The shoe is sturdy and well made... hopefully they keep making it the same."
newbalance Love this sneaker.  I can always tell when it's time for a new pair since my knee pain comes back!
newbalance newbalance is a respected name in the shoe world. And for good reason this is a excellent pair of shoes!  I work at resort as valet! So I am on my feet all the time! These shoes do the job! Worth the purchase.
newbalance I wear a 10 D and learned the hard way to order New  Balance a size bigger and wider to get the right fit 101/2/ E-2
newbalance Well just gave a this review on a pair of jeans I ordered at the same time .people are going to look at it and scratch their head in wonder . Any way these shoes fit great . Feet don't hurt wearing these . So glad  my wife bought  them for me
"newbalance Pros. The same shoe I buy at the store !!!!! now, I don't have to go to the store.<br/>Cons. At the store some of the boxes are Made in USA and most are made else ware.<br/>I always want to purchase made in the USA when and ware I can. Made in USA is American Jobs."
newbalance Returned it because the tread makes A LOT of noise on any surface.  What was newbalance thinking when they designed that tread pattern?<br/><br/>Went out and bought the newbalance 619's with memory foam because they're awesome.  The 608V4's would have been fine for the price if the bottom tread pattern was the same as their other shoes.
"newbalance I have been a newbalance guy since I was little. I love the shoes, because they come in wide up to 6E. I was sort of getting tired of the white shoes that have been around for ever by them. I cant remember the model number, but then I saw these. These are sort of a cross between the older design and a skate shoe. I love these. They look modern, but no to crazy in style. I think this will be my new white shoe of choice from now on."
"newbalance These are great shoes for me. I've had them before and liked them, and these are just as good."
"newbalance I am diabetic, so feet are sore a lot and I am very picky about footwear.These fit perfectly and I wore them for 8 hours on the first day..almost unheard of for me...never get anything else. Also, thanks for offering SO MANY sizes!! And price is great!"
newbalance Very comfortable. The last newbalance shoes I bought felt awkward. That was years ago. These are very good.
"newbalance newbalance shoes tend to fit my feet better than other major brands so from experience I was comfortable ordering online. The NB 608 is a nice looking shoe in a traditional style without all the flashy wild colors/patterns (showing my age here??) that are prevalent in so many athletic shoes. Great for trail walking, training, and casual wear. More color options at Amazon than were available at a local store."
newbalance My husband loves these .  I purchased two pairs.  They fit just right and are very comfortable.
"newbalance I just had Plantar F. surgery on both feet so I had to find an entirely new walking/trailing shoe. I've worn ASICS Men's Gel-Flux 2 (series) for the last 9 years, but the shoes wasn't comfortable enough for all-day use. I decided to try the entire line up of NB to find the right pair, and by far, these have worked the best for endurance and fit. They worked so good I bought the trailing version ""M"" Series. For sore feet; such as heels, arch, etc. you won't find a more comfortable, supportive shoe for the money."
newbalance Very happy with shoes. I have been wearing a 8 1/2 W for most of my life. The 8 1/2 are to short and they keep my toes sore. The 9 2E seem to be a perfect fit.
newbalance Great shoes. Predictable model for size and form
"newbalance newbalance makes/sells the only running/cross-training shoes wide enough to fit my feet comfortably, at least they are the only brand I've found.  I've been wearing NB cross-trainers for many years.  Unfortunately, NB seems compelled to tinker with what once was an outstanding product.  Earlier versions provided much better and, therefore, more comfortable support than do the more recent versions.  Replacing the original insoles with SuperFeet insoles is necessary, in my case at least, to make them suitable for all day wear.  I think NB needs to go back and figure out where they went wrong."
"newbalance The MX608 is a great all-purpose sneaker.  I ordered 2 pairs, one of which was a little small, so be careful on sizing if you are between sizes.  My initial impression out of the box is that this latest version of the MX608 is the most comfortable to date.  I have worn this model shoe for many years now.  It has some very good features.  The sole is very durable, with traction being average.  The insole is easily removable in case you use orthotics.  Initially they are a little on the stiff side, but my experience has been that these shoes only get more comfortable with age. I highly recommend them."
newbalance Everything great I tried it if it's good look good very happy with it thank you very much
newbalance Very comfortable.<br/>Great for walking. Think airports.<br/>Not really a running shoe.
"newbalance I order size 16 4E of the newbalance Men's MX608V4, but they fit like size 15 with a size 16 label on it. Even the insole didn't fit in the shoe. I didn't use until the weather was nice for a running shoes, so it is to late to return product.  I have order other newbalance shoes that are different versions and they fit fine and have no complaints.  I think it was a manufacture mistake."
newbalance Nice shoes for working out at the gym. They are well made and feel extremely comfortable.
newbalance Nice tennis shoe...bought for a friend that has Diabetes and he thought they were very comfortable...
"newbalance my husband who usually wears slippers all the time at any time of the year, loves them..."
"newbalance Bought these shoes for my Husband, who is kind of tough on shoes, so I took a chance because this brand is all I wear.  They are so beautiful in a<br/>Royal Blue,  and he wore them all day.  Can't believe my luck. We are both happy people.  Man of the house is happy, and woman of the house feels proud I made such a good choice. Wrapped great, but so easy to unwrap to put on.  These are great for any Man."
"newbalance This is my third or fourth pair of MX608's.  I am big and find that the added width of these shoes over some others provides a more stable platform when working out.  I generally use them only for workouts for the first 6 months or so and then let them become my everyday shoes.  After 6 to 9 months, the uppers are stretched and don't provide the snug fit I prefer, so I get another pair.  I feel the price is reasonable and find the selection of colors a nice feature.  But note that the colored shoes (mine are dark blue) have a suede-like upper and they show dust fairly easily."
newbalance I should have ordered an E width instead of a D. My fault. Other then that a great shoe
newbalance I've bought this shoe before but this pair sometimes makes a squeaky sound when I walk.
"newbalance Another great shoe from newbalance.<br/>The fit on this version feels slightly tighter in the toe box (tips of toes) so it may feel snug at first. I believe this due to the change in insole material  to memory foam instead of traditional EVA foam. I'm not a  big fan of memory foam in this application because its always expanding, but it makes for a cushy shoe.<br/>I install my own insoles after a few days so it really isn't an issue for me."
newbalance I own many newbalance shoes that I have bought over the years and this is the 1st pair that I have had any issues with. The side of the shoe near the toe on the outside has worn a hole in it in just 2 months now. I wear these at work and have had other newbalance shoes I have worn more not do this. I am very disappointed in these shoes. Ill have to decide whether I will buy the same again or not
"newbalance The Newbalance  608  has been my choic e for years. It also works with my orthotics when I tale out the factory sole, a real plus."
newbalance I needed huge shoes to fit over a foot brace I must wear every waking hour. These work. A rare find. One problem: they squeak.
"newbalance I've been wearing these for years and have always been satisfied with comfort, support, price and consistency ."
"newbalance Great shoes with wonderful shock absorption, which is important to me.  Look great too.  Very good price as well.  I keep re-orderning I need new ones as these are great comfortable, good looking shoes."
newbalance like newbalance just wish sole would last longer 6 months then I have to think of getting new pair a year would b nice
"newbalance Jack of all trades, master of none.  Wear them to work, run, hike, workout, etc..  Had them soaking wet many times.  I'm 51 and have worn out many athletic shoes. This pair lasted a year.  608v4 is probably the best pair of shoes I've ever owned."
"newbalance I have probably owned over 20 pair of newbalance shoes. They are generally confortable and durable. Even this particular model has worked for me in the past.<br/><br/>On the 3rd day I wore these the part of the sole that wraps up in front of the toe became unglued on the right shoe. I waited too long aparently to return them as the return window has closed.<br/><br/>I waited to start using these sneakers until my old pair wore out, which was 3 days ago. The shoes still look brand new because they are. I am screwed because i waited to start wearing them.<br/><br/>Shoes have a manufacturing defect but i can't return them. Very dissapointed. I hope Amazon or NB will make this right."
newbalance They work great.  I stumbled around in Florida for a week and my feet were quite happy.
newbalance These were for my husband and he loves newbalance. They fit as expected. Just what he wanted.
newbalance Bought these because I had a pair before and loved them. This time they fit perfect as well but the quality of at least one shoes is not as good as before. I think it may be defect as the other shoe is fine but the material on the heel has already began to wear away. Hoping this is just a one time problem as in general I love these shoes an plan to buy another pair in hopes of not having this problem.
"newbalance My husband loves these shoes.  We've bought a few pair now, they are his go to shoes."
"newbalance Okay, I'll admit that I've owned this particular model of shoes before.  I love them because I have really managed to mangle my feet and, as a result, it can be very painful to wear any other type of shoe.  The people I work with understand but I also don't like to run around in a business setting with brightly colored fluorescent shoes.  These are EXTREMELY comfortable and, even with my feet, allow me to stay on my feet all day.  They also are very discrete since they are plain black and don't shout ""Sneakers!"" when I'm around people wearing ""dress shoes"".  Great shoes!"
"newbalance I love newbalance and these are no exception.  Yes, they are white.  Yes, they are ""plain"".  Yes, they are awesome!"
"newbalance We're really hard on shoes, especially my father, and having owned these for three days, there are already flat spots in the padding where his toes have been pushing and wearing. These are still the go-to tennis shoes for us; we've probably been through a dozen pair in the last four years. The construction is good, so we just replace the insole when it finally dies (this one, again, less than four days).<br/><br/>In his words, the shoes are ""comfortable as hell until they started wearing out,"" which he meant as a good thing. For me, well, I'm still on the last pair, but the wear is beginning."
newbalance I just love it when I find a shoe that fits like it is supposed to fit!!  This is the third pair I have purchased over the past couple of years and I just hope they continue to be available!
newbalance Lasted 50 days before the levt sole came off. 4 months less than my last pair. I only threw that pair out because they were lookin ratty
newbalance This was a repurchase as the first pair has lasted a few years and not showing significant wear other than the sole.
"newbalance It took a few days to break them in, but they are extremely comfortable and sturdy."
"newbalance This s my 3rd pair of 608's, each a different style. Ths pair is for power walking, and is the best shoe I've found for the purpose"
newbalance newbalance is a shoe I always buy because the 2E width seems to fit my feet the best
newbalance newbalance shoes are the only ones I consider because they are a perfect fit for my feet!
newbalance Excellent shoe for the money...this was a repeat purchase.  Would strongly recommend...
newbalance Great quality and perfect fit for exercising and walking.  I like these very much.
newbalance Good sneakers- they're comfortable for walking around in and make a good substitute for black work duty shoes
newbalance Purchased these shoes in Navy color in January and within a couple months I noticed the color faded to the point that they look like my 4 - 5 year old shoes I take out to do yard work in. The only difference is these are a swede material while my old ones were some faux leather or synthetic material.  I haven't done anything to then other than wear them like normal but they look horrible now. Next time I'll  just go to a shoe shop or get the non swede versions or these.
newbalance This has become my go to shoe for walking 3 miles 4 times a week on the treadmill.  They are very comfortable and do not cause any discomfort for my sensitive feet.  Nice all leather shoe that holds up well.
"newbalance Extremely tight only around the big toe. I couldn't walk more than 2 steps without pain, and I never thought a shoe could create such pain so quickly."
"newbalance On April 04, 2017, I ordered two pairs of MX608V4 shoes, in a very short time, the soles began to seperate from the upper on one shoe.<br/>I attempted to glue together, but it didn't work.<br/><br/>I had a similiar experience, previously, but did not report it.<br/><br/>There appears to be a consistent problem with this product.<br/><br/>I am disappointed to say the least.<br/>Billy Cline"
"newbalance First pair too tight, 1/2 size up was right.  Runs a tad too small, for this brand."
newbalance These WAY outlast the Nike's I was buying in the past! Even after several washes.
"newbalance I had an accident that made my left foot a bit longer than my right foot. Therefore, I fit all of my shoes on the left foot. Although these shoes fit just a little bit titter on my left foot, but believe that if I go for shoes a size above 13 E, they will be too big for my right foot. I believe that with time, the left shoe will expand to fit better and more comfortable on my left foot. That is my dilemma. I have to deal with it the best way I can."
"newbalance Trash.  Pure garbage.  I've been wearing newbalance shoes for the past 10 years.  Typically, a pair lasts me 6 - 8 months.  After 2 months of use, the insoles in these shoes just started falling apart.  Chunks of the memory foam just falling out at random.  This will probably be the end of my run with newbalance.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
newbalance I hope to buy more of this model in the future.  Others seem tight. These don't.
"newbalance nice and comfortable, great shoes could not ask for better keep up the good work"
"newbalance Great fit and very comfortable. This model now has gel pockets inside so I don't need to by the inserts, which I've had to do with older models. I've always gotten years of service from this model and only end up changing due to them being dirty. I've never had a failure from a newbalance shoe and the quality and grip is better than the other brands I have used in the past. I highly recommend."
newbalance Very comfortable and supportive. I'm a big person and these shoes are great for me
newbalance I usually purchase a 13 medium. This pair was a bit on the narrow side. I returned them for a wide.
newbalance The 2e was fine but it's a bit hard to put the on.  Once on the fit is perfect.
newbalance I've never had a pair of shoes fit so close across my toes and hope I get used to it.
"newbalance I don't know what happened to newbalance but it looks like these were made overseas buy some children.... very poor material ,very small shoe.did not fit  sent it back and got another brand... if you buy these shoes better get two sizes bigger then normal or they won't fit"
newbalance Goods shoes at a great price.I always buy trainers 1 inch bigger and never go wrong.
"newbalance The shoe is very comfortable.  The regular width is on the somewhat narrow side, but that is perfect for my somewhat narrow feet.  Have not tried taking several mile walks in it yet, but it is perfectly comfortable for 1-2 mile brisk walks.  The maroonish brown color is exactly what it looked like on the web site and just what I wanted.  Can't comment on durability, since I have had them less than a week."
newbalance My husband loves these shoes.  When they wear out he orders the exact same pair.
newbalance Very comfortable right from the time I put them on.  Just what I expected from newbalance.  I always wear them when working out and they also look nice!
"newbalance This is my 2nd pair of this shoe. I used to wear the Nike Air but got tired of the relentless squeaking.<br/> I purchased these for the looks and quickly found out I needed extra support - although they may feel great for you as is. I added some Red Wing insoles and they quickly became my all-around favorite shoe. They match any clothing I wear and can even be passed off a dress shoes in a pinch, yet provide the all day comfort of sneakers. Plus, no squeaking!"
"newbalance Great shoes, couldn't find any 16 locally so very happy with Amazon selection."
newbalance Saved enough on Amazon will buy all my shoes there. newbalance are the most comfortable.
newbalance So far they are great shoes and the quality is there as well. I will return in a few months with an update. Good Buy!
"newbalance Fits well, very comfortable. The 4E size is perfect for it you need wider shoes."
newbalance I've worn newbalance for year but these seem to be the best fitting to date.
"newbalance The actual shoe looks nice and is of nice quality.  HOWEVER, I ORDERED THE WHITE/NAVY AND RECEIVED WHITE/GREEN.  We had an event scheduled and needed the shoes and therefore did not have time to return them.  I am now left with a color that I did not expect, nor order."
newbalance I like these tennis shoes. I've had a pair before that's why I purchased these.
newbalance They fit great And I have found them to be very comfortable. Would buy them again.
"newbalance The newbalance 605 shoes, size 8.5 2E US, fit perfectly...very comfortable."
"newbalance I've had this brand before. A nice shoe, I hope these shoes hold up like the previous pair,"
newbalance Perfect fit for me.  Felt like they were broken in the first time I put them on.
"newbalance size was just right and fit perfect, the wide gave me a more comfortable fit and they feel good on the feet."
newbalance Very comfortable shoes for walking. Size was perfect. 12e Well constructed.
newbalance These shoes fit perfect and are extremely comfortable right out of the box.
newbalance Very disappointed in the durability of these shoes (blue suede upper).  I have had them less than 6 weeks and the upper material is ripping in three different spots on the right shoe.  I only wear them casually 3 or 4 days each week.  I don't exercise in them or put a lot of stress other than walking.  Also disappointed with Amazon's return policy only being 1 month.  Hope there is another option for products with defects that show after the 1 month period.
newbalance Had to send back and re-order as the V4 runs 1/2 size smaller than the V3.
"newbalance I have worn NB shoes for years. They keep my feet, legs and back form hurting."
newbalance My husband loves these shoes.  Bought one in black and one in white.  Both fit great
newbalance Order came in a timely matter.  Shoes are good looking and very comfortable.  We buy them again.
newbalance They seem well made and are pretty comfortable- I would have given 5 stars but I still needed to put some work orthopedic insoles in them to be able to work comfortably all day walking and standing.
newbalance No arch support. Had to add insole to get adequate cushioning. Update: giving them away after 3 days. Feet hurt everytime I wear them.
newbalance Great width. Hard to find. Should be fine. I expect the newbalance wear.
"newbalance The shoes fit well and I can wear them all day for work.  I purchased a set of insoles for arch supports, as for my feet there was very little. However, there is a  big problem! The finish sole of the shoe has started to separate from the shoe. I have never had an issue like this with any footwear before. This should not happen with wear for a year,  but after only 5 months I would have to call the quality, poor.  Now I have to once again search for footwear."
"newbalance Great shoe, almost identical to the N.B. 608 shoes I bought 10+ years ago &amp; haven't been able to find in newbalance stores (or any stores for that matter).  The fit is a bit tight so either the mfr./supplier has made some changes or my foot had grown some."
"newbalance I work in a warehouse and am on my feet 10-12 hours and at the end of the day, these shoes are heavy as Lead! I should have purchased the lighter shoes and not the leather. They also squeak very badly and my co workers tease me daily. They said I sound like mice walking."
newbalance Consistent product I wear daily - Amazon has the best quality and price.
newbalance Decent quality shoes. I wear a D sized shoe (american) and it fits fine.
"newbalance The fitting of the shoe was right on the mark, and the assistance you offer by keeping your records on hand in regards to my previous purchase's is a great tool in helping. I was surprised by this and very pleased. I will definitely use this service whenever it is available.The delivery time was perfect and was here as you stated. You continue to improve your service, products, and prices are very competitive, which keeps me a happy customer and who will keep coming back. -- Thank You!! --"
"newbalance Most comfortable shoes I own. Makes me jump higher, run faster and love longer"
newbalance very nice shoe.  It fits better than the pair I got at the outlet store.
newbalance Too narrow to be comfortable..ordered 9 1/2 D that I thought would be wider.
newbalance This is the only sneak that fits me properly.  I have had several pair.
newbalance These have the memory foam inserts and are so comfortable. I have other newbalances but the 608's are still my favorite.
newbalance just remember to order 1/2 size up from your normal shoe all fits well
newbalance My husband has trouble with his feet and these shoes are a life saver.
newbalance My husband loves the newbalance brand.  He uses them for work where he walks a lot.  They are comfortable and they last.  Well made shoe.
newbalance Love them I work in a warehouse on concrete floors. For a while by the end of thew day my back and feet were killing me. I have wide feet so buy regular sneaker would only help short term as I would wear them out in a couple month or because my feet are wide they would start causeing pain and I developed a corn on a toe from the friction of having shoes that were too tight. So these are a blessing so far.
newbalance Love newbalance tennis shoes for my dad. He won't buy any other shoes and these were amazing for him.
newbalance First pair where too large.  Exchange was easy and new shoes fit perfectly.
"newbalance Shoes fit.  The only problem I had in ordering was there was no filter for size . When you have large feet like me ,options are limited.  This is true in stores . Salesmen ask"" what brand and type of shoe I want "" ? I say"" bring me ALL the shoes in my size"" . They come back and say ""we have this one and that one"". Its just easier that way."
newbalance Holding up very well.  Comfortable and great support.  Can't be beat.
"newbalance I have the exact same model and size shoe and love them. bought this to replace the worn out pair. they fit much smaller, a little narrower and my toe touches the tip. Cant use these."
"newbalance Very comfortable and supportive shoe. Though it is a leather, it's a light shoe and very flexible."
newbalance A good shoe for a general workout at a great price.  I was very happy with the purchase at fit.
newbalance Nice shoe.  These are light and look good.  Fit perfect for my size.
newbalance These fit extremely well and are comfortable enough to wear every day.
"newbalance Quality control at newbalance must be slipping.  This shoe is narrower than the 10 2E I bought 3 years ago, both in feel and in physically comparing the sole and last profile.  Has nothing to do with the other shoe having been worn. Will be returning and reordering (ONE more time only, before I give up on newbalance online)."
"newbalance Laces should have been 54"" as they are too long for safety reasons."
"newbalance My husband says he loves these sneakers and wears them every day.  They are very nice looking, solidly constructed, and fit comfortably.  I notice the price keeps going up though."
"newbalance These are the right pair of shoes for me. Work walking/standing on concrete with them all day. They help my posture, overall have good support, and are very light. Go to the store shopping and you forget you have them on. Highly Recommend, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair."
newbalance Took a risk and ordered on-line after visiting a retail and checking for sizes.  Perfect fit. Good quality.
"newbalance I have bought, so far, three pairs of these exact shoes. I bought the first pair as a gift for a friend. When they came I liked them so much I bought a pair for myself, which I have on as I type this. By friend's wife complained to me that her husband wears them both to do heavy duty yard work and to take her to dinner as well. I then bought him a second pair for ""dress"". Really good support for an athletic shoe and especially attractive to hunters and outdoors-men."
"newbalance I was a LONG time 608V2 wearer, I purchased many pairs as I wore them at work 12-14 hrs /day average. newbalance saw fit to fix something that wasn't broken. I thought I would try the V4, NOTHING like the V2.<br/>I now wear another brand, apparently on a permanent basis."
newbalance Great shoes.  I've had three pairs and will wear these as long as NB makes them. So NB don't discontinue this model!! Please
newbalance Poorly fitting shoe. Lacks support. Very disappointed in this shoe.
newbalance Son says they fit great and very comfortable it is his third pairüòÄ
"newbalance They feel somewhat small, but hopefully the leather will stretch some."
newbalance Fits perfect for 8.5  Great shoe.  Using it on the racquetball court.
newbalance These are my favorite shoes to run my route in. They even come in my size and I find my size is pretty rare. They keep my feet dry and comfortable! I have been through 6 pair of these. They usually last about 4 months with walking about 5 miles a day - weekends too!! So thats about 600 miles!!! I would say thats pretty good for a reasonably priced shoe!
newbalance I've been wearing 608's for sometime and these did not disappoint.
newbalance I tried to wear them a few times but it did not help. They were a size 13 the same size as my other newbalance shoes. I could not get them to fit right so I gave them to a friend who wears a size 12 and he tells me they fit him fine. I guess I should of sent them back but it is too late now.
"newbalance I ordered three pairs of newbalance Shoes and all were size 10.5 and wide.  Two of the pairs were about a size smaller than they were supposed to be, but still a 10.5.  Only one pair of the three was a real 10.5 wide.  When you set all three pairs next to each other....  they are all a different size though, like I mentioned earlier, they were all supposed to be a 10.5.  This is the only paid of the three I ordered that fit like my old pair of newbalance and feel correct to the size."
newbalance I now have two pair. This color fits slightly better than the white.
"newbalance Fast delivery, exactly as ordered, at a pretty good price. These sneakers have better insoles than previous pairs."
"newbalance Usually wear size 10, Size 10 in the last pair, same brand, style, and product line, was a little tight. So I ordered 10.5 this time. Should have ordered size 11. Great except the pair I got was small for size. Would have been 4 stars if the size ran standard. Or maybe even 5 stars if they fit and broke in great."
newbalance Ordered the wide shoe due to a foot defect I have.  Normally have difficulity with shoes but these fit very well
"newbalance This is my usual Nike shoes that I buy because I like them, and they work well for my feet."
"newbalance Just got these, they seem well made but only weigh HALF of the what the old pair weighs.  THINNER and cheaper than before."
newbalance Been wearing this shoe for years at work when I'm on my feet a lot...yet looks neat.
"newbalance This is my fourth pair..I am hard to fit because I need a 4E..these fit..very comfortable and good quality at this price point..I am ordering 2 more pair just in case NB should discontinue this model..MX608V4,,"
"newbalance I usually buy NB 623, but opted to go on the wild side and try the 608s.  I use a custom orthopedic device in my shoes and my feet feel pretty good after a long day at the office.  The 623 last about a year before being switched out to become yard work shoes. I hope to get at least a year out of the 608.  We'll see."
newbalance Bought these as a gift for my brother. He loves them! I can always count on newbalance shoes! True to size and look great.
"newbalance I purchased these shoes on a recommendation. I haven't yet worn them enough to know if they are too small. I was surprised at how small they felt because I have worn the same size shoes from multiple companies over many years.Hopefully, they will stretch enough to be useful."
"newbalance Thee shoes are OK, but not as good as the Nike Air ones they replace."
"newbalance My husband has worn newbalance for many years, and this newbalance style provides the comfort and good support that he has always found in newbalance.  I was glad to see Amazon had this shoe in the extra wide width which is normally very difficult to find.  The shoe was delivered on time, and was exactly as described as well as giving him the perfect fit.  He needed a newbalance in black which is also difficult to find.  I would highly recommend this shoe."
newbalance My husband will only wear newbalance. They are good as always.
newbalance I like newbalance and have bought quite a few shoes from them.
"newbalance Comfortable, long lasting, rugged, and all around everyday shoe"
newbalance 5th pair always fit. Wear great. If you have wide feet like me I recommend these shoes.
newbalance Very happy with shoes and purchasing experience. Thank you so much!
newbalance This is the 3rd pair of NB's we've purchased for hubby with very wide feet. Consistently fit well and comfortable.
newbalance At first they felt great after a week not so much; after two weeks I bought something else
"newbalance Great quality shoe, just runs small. Seller was fantastic! :O)"
"newbalance Bought as gift, andvthey fit well and he kept them. Should give 5 stars just for that!"
newbalance So far I'm pleased. Hope they will stand up to the test of time.
newbalance Don't feel like they have a lot of arch support. Sizing is as expected and the workmanship is ok.
"newbalance As always, newbalance - true to size and comfortable to wear."
"newbalance Really a nice product with excellent delivery.  Thanks, David"
"newbalance They were a little stiffer out of the box than I'd hoped for (foot problems) but fit fine and construction seems fine. Good for the price,imo."
newbalance I have been wearing 608 and 623 for about ten years and the last 6 pair have only lasted for 3 months before the bottoms came off but least they were comfortable. These feel like I am wearing cardboard. Whenever I put these on my feet knees and feet start to hurt. I work in a hospital so my shoes are not exposed to harsh environment. On the bright side I have had them for a month and they won't last much longer but they may go in the trash before I hit the 3 month mark
newbalance Had bought a pair for my husband about 8 months ago. Reordered because he liked them so much.
"newbalance I've worn these shoes for years.  I wear 13 EEEE, so it's not like I can pop into any shoe store and grab a pair.  The newbalance 608 fits right and hold up well.  That makes it easy to order the same shoe when I need a new pair."
"newbalance NO SUPPORT ,ALL FOAM.WAY TOO SOFT .,I HAVE BEEN WEARING 608 newbalance MANY YEARS .THEY HAVE CHANGED SOMETHING IN SUPPORT"
"newbalance All around good shoe, especially suited for wide duck feet guys like me. Biggest complaint is the flimsy narrow soles which seem designed to wear out a little too soon. Of course, they can't be fixed or replaced so cough up for a new pair.<br/><br/>UPDATE - 7 months later and the heels are worn down. I only use these 5 days a week for a half hour of jogging. So, I subtract to 3 stars. I did find neolite heels that can be shoe glued on at $10 a pair. It adds a few more months to the shoe life."
newbalance Good shoe at a reasonable price. I wear 9 wide. Fit just right.
newbalance Love them...so comfortable. Took on vacation - fit perfectly.
newbalance Nice. I would have gotten a slightly wider pair if I had know how they fit. But they stretched enough to be comfortable. 10.5 D. Probably go with 10.5 2E next time.
newbalance Bought for my husband. Fit as expected and timely delivery.
"newbalance I like the shoe, but I think it was ""sized"" incorrectly.<br/><br/>My previous purchase: was perfect!<br/><br/>This shoe, is about a half-size too small.<br/><br/>This causes me some pain after a 9-hour work day.<br/><br/>But the overall quality of this product is ""Good"".<br/><br/>John Tobin"
newbalance Fix great comfortable but both shoes lean a little bit to the left .
"newbalance Good shoes, I did get 0.5 larger shoe size than I usually do, they sizes are small."
newbalance 3rd pair i have purchased in past few years. Good support. Wear well and clean up easily
"newbalance newbalance in my humble opinion is the best shoe on the market place, I tried another brand last time and ended up with a bruised achillies tendon from the rolled up padding in the back of the shoe.  Sad part was the other shoe was more expensive and I anticipated it would be a better quality.  Sometimes ""you get what you pay for"" isn't absolutely the truth.<br/><br/>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IYB58HM?redirect=true&amp;ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_12"
newbalance Love these sneakers  They're comfortable and fit perfectly.
"newbalance I've bought only newbalance shoes just like this on for many years. The shoe is still a good value, but, they are manufactured in China now are are undersized. I normally wear size 11 and have since high school. I had to start buying 11 1/2's. To be fair, I also had to start buying 11 1/2's in other shoes too except for shoes my dress shoes which are made in the US."
"newbalance These newbalance Shoes are the only ones my Husband will wear for work. He'll usually purchase a couple of pairs at a time, just to be sure he has them on hand. He's on his feet the entire day- typically 11-12 hour shift. They are sturdy, and comfortable. It's hard to find and entirely black pair of sneakers, most have some other color design or logo, which he can't wear for work. So it's dress shoes,which would be so uncomfortable for all day wear, or these. For anyone who has to be on their feet all day these are a great option."
newbalance Great product for the money!  I liked the size options that are available.
"newbalance Although the fit and comfort are great the heal separates from the shoe in a matter of months. Shoe looks and feels good but very poor bonding. I bought another pair before. Thought it was a fluke so I bough these and was equally disapointed. called NB and got nowhere. hey asked if I had been sized lately. What has that got to do with shoe falling apart at the sole.And yes,I was sized properly."
"newbalance Bought  these athletic shoes for my husband to play tennis in. As  he does not wear them all day, we can't know how they would do in extended wear.  He chose  his usual size and  they fit well.  I  hear no complaints so I am  sure they are fine for the tennis game.  One person remarked how clunky they looked, but in fact they look like any other white tennis shoe.  If you don;t want your shoe noticed, buy one of the dark multicolored ones that at are very popular now!  newbalance is a brand with a deserved reputation for good quality."
newbalance Great shoes.  First I've found in 12 1/2.  Fits perfectly.
"newbalance Good quality shoe that I can get in the extra wide size. newbalance has been a good shoe for me and this pair is as well. I play racquetball with these shoes, and they have good support and court grip, without causing blistering. Overall good shoe. I would have given 5 stars, but when I first put them on, they felt snug, but after one game the shoe was comfortable."
"newbalance perfect,  great fit  and  delivered early and in great shape"
"newbalance Always can rely on Amazon for just about anything. This is a regular purchase, good price fast delivery. Great job"
newbalance My feet are like paddles and the 4E wide shoes perfectly fit.
"newbalance These shoes were not the correct size. They were a 7.5 shoe, but they were much smaller than the 623 model 7.5 which I have purchase three pair of over the past few years."
newbalance Great shoes ! Purchased another pair ! My son loves them.
"newbalance Ordered 2E, the package and shoe list 2E, but they are nearly as wide as my NewBalance 4E."
newbalance Feels smaller in the toe width than previous newbalance of the same width.
"newbalance As a nurse working 12 hour shifts on an ICU unit, I'm in constant search of the most comfortable shoe out there. This newbalance MX608V4 is good for about 8 hours before I start to think about getting off my feet for a while."
newbalance A great deal on a very good and comfortable pair of shoes.
"newbalance I walk a lot and wear through shoes very quickly.  I also wear orthotics that may change the way shoes wear.  In this case, the back of the shoe started wearing through in a few weeks.  Unrelated to any walking, one of the eyelets started to tear.  I don't tie my shoes any harder or more often than the next guy.  These were junk."
"newbalance The shoe fit as expected but two of the holes for the shoestring broke within days and Amazon would not take them back. Very disappointed. I have been purchasing these shoes for years and this is the first time I've ever had a problem but they seem to be made much cheaper this time. I don't know if it's Amazon or newbalance, I just know I'm out $60 and I bought ASICS instead..."
"newbalance I only buy NB shoes and have the 608V3 and love them.  The 608V4 has the same basic fit, but seems more flimsy than the V3.  But the deal-breaker for me is that when walk they pinch right at the big toe joint on the inside of the shoe, both on the left and on the right.  I believe this is due to the flimsy material at that location.  When it bends, it pinches.  I'm sending them back."
newbalance newbalance Shoes always please me.  Helps my back problems.
newbalance We've bought several pairs of these for my son's size 11 4E feet. They seem to be his favourite and he wears them until they fall apart. Excellent for wide feet.
newbalance My very fussy adult son received these for his birthday....said he loved them!
newbalance not quite the same as the 608 I replaced.  Fit and Finish is still good.  Replaced old 608's due to being slippery  otherwise still holding up even after many times in the washer.  Only had these several weeks time will tell.
"newbalance Only worn them once, but are comfortable and the 4E are wide enough."
"newbalance I've worn this number before, in fact I have on a pair now so I knew how they would fit."
"newbalance Love the shoe, However I only use this for work. I sit at a desk 8hrs a day and thought the brown would look better than the white. I have never used it for anything other than work and the side has split rendering the shoe worthless"
newbalance Appear to be well made. Good looking and very comfortable.
"newbalance This is the third pair of newbalance 608s that I've bought in the last few years or more. The shoes are very light and comfortable.  However, there is one glaring problem with my last two pair:  The soles came loose starting at the heel... prematurely.  I havent contacted newbalance about this problem but I guarantee that I will if this third pair falls apart.  These shoes are too expensive to have the soles come off otherwise perfectly good shoes.  So while I gave them 4 stars, that rating may change down the road."
newbalance Not much is perfect in this world but so far these shoes are very good. At this point I have no complaints.
"newbalance These may not be the most stylish athletic shoes out there but they are durable, offer very good support and the sizing from this seller was varied. In stores I seem to be able to find 4D or 4E, neither of which works ideally. The 2E width was perfect. I walk long distances in them, but also wear them for a lot of daily activities. As I get older it's great to have a bit more support to aid the knees and back."
"newbalance My husband goes through shoes so fast, feels like I'm buying new ones every couple of months. Yes had these for almost a year with no problems. They fit as expected and look as they do in the picture."
newbalance newbalance makes excellent shoes for people who have large wide feet.  newbalance was recommended by my podiatrist due to certain issues I  have with my feet.  I highly recommend this particular shoe for people who spend a lot of time on their feet each day.  There are a good variety of color options to choose from as well as size options.  I find that newbalance are true-to-size as compared to other brands that I have purchased.
newbalance Price-wise is what I was looking for also the fit was right. For my size which is a six and a half it's very hard to go to a local shoe store or sneaker chain to find something in a man's size they should put six and a half in the stores and lots of stores say they don't carry it in a men's size
newbalance Even though I ordered a wide it fits tight in the front
"newbalance They looked good but were not a true size, I had to order a different brand in the same size to get a good fit."
"newbalance Great shoes, very comfortable.  Perfect walking shoes."
newbalance I buy these shoes all the time. They fit me well and are comfortable.
"newbalance Just received them, only worn once, but so far so good"
newbalance I would have preferred the wider shoe but this is comfortable.
newbalance My husband loves these shoes. He is 100per cent disabled and I look for deals on these black ones especially because he is outside so much. He wears a brace on his right foot and leg and need the 4E to fit it into the shoe. It works well for him. I look for specials all the time. He won't wear anything but newbalance. Thank you for you sales.
"newbalance I loved the mx1012, but of course it has been discontinued. The replacement for that shoe is only available in bright workout colors, which don't suit my intended purposes of casual and work wear.<br/><br/>These are even more comfortable. I will say that these are also stiffer on the sides, which is a negative if you have to lean and lunge... but they are still breaking in so only time will tell.<br/><br/>I ordered the grey and couldn't be happier."
newbalance These shoes are extremely comfortable.  I tend to read tons of reviews before purchasing shoes online and despite the negative reviews felt it was worth the gamble.  I wear these as my on duty shoes as a fireman and I love them.  10 times more comfortable than my issued station boots.  Can't comment on how long they hold up as of yet but they are super comfortable right out of the box and for $50 you can't go wrong.
newbalance I'VE BEEN USING newbalance PRODUCTS FOR YEARS &amp; THEY ARE SUPERB IN EVERY WAY~~~~!!!!!!
newbalance Great shoe. These shoes fit great. I am very pleased.
"newbalance So far so good. I've walked about 20 miles (longest walk about 5 miles) and they are comfortable and supportive. I have to snug the laces well or they move around a bit, making them seem a bit bigger than I'm used to and I've been wearing the same size in newbalance shoes for years. Deducted a star for the sizing. Snug those laces and you'll probably be fine."
newbalance I have been wearing this brand for years and love them!
"newbalance They look good and seem to be well made. They fit nicely, too."
newbalance I have been wearing the V4 for over the last few uears. V3 does not fit as well as this one does so be careful when you purchase these shoes.
newbalance It's what you expect when you buy newbalance trainers!!
newbalance Fit right out of box. No break in required. Comfortable. Would definitely  buy again.
newbalance Fits right! Feels good! Does exactly what you want it to do!
"newbalance I have worn newbalance for year due to my size 10, 4E width (read: Fred Flintstone) feet.  This particular model They are the least expensive shoe that I can wear due to the size/width and other issues I have with my feet.  I like that I was able to pick from several color options and basically get the price that I would pay locally on sale or with a coupon."
newbalance I've been using V3's for a couple of years &amp; not sure what's different about V4's but on initial wearing they feel great! They (V3s) last 6 months to a year depending on how much walking I do. Price on Amazon was really good!<br/><br/>I've been wearing them around the house but haven't been doing any serious walking in them yet. They feel very comfortable. The heel is hollowed out (to save money?) &amp; the soles are slightly different.
newbalance Duplicate of what I already own which I really like.
newbalance I've been wearing these shoes for years.  Love them.
newbalance A first rate walking shoe and for a very fair price.
newbalance Comfortable fits as it should.  Good wearing shoe!!!
newbalance They fit perfectly and are very comfortable to wear.
newbalance Hubby loves newbalance and this color! Great price Amazon!
"newbalance great shoes, wear them daily as a del driver making over 200 enters and exits combined out of truck, feet never feel tired or soar even after 12 hours in these shoes"
"newbalance Good shoes, high quality, comfortable. I wear them almost everyday at work where I stand for long hours. I bought the size 11 2E and it's a little roomy, maybe a 10.5 would have fit more snugly but overall great product."
"newbalance My husband has so much trouble finding comfortable shoes, especially for work, due to his feet being large and extra wide. These shoes are such a blessing. He can work all day walking on a concrete floor. We love the lower price, too"
"newbalance Superb quality that I have learned to expect from newbalance, my go to shoes."
"newbalance I only wear newbalance 4E shoes for daily wear because their last in that size fits my feet perfectly. I only wish they made a dress shoe on that last because no one makes one that fits my freakishly high instep. I, like everyone else, was born with flat feet, which concerned my mother. She fell victim to a shady salesman who sold her on ""special"" arch supports, which, once I learned to walk, deformed my feet to the extent that my barefoot footprint is only heel and anterior transverse arch, and hardly any commercial shoes have fit since."
"newbalance I always have had trouble getting a shoe that fits. I ordered the 4 E shoe in 81/2 and the shoe fits perfectly. It is great to have a manufacturer make a shoe in this size. Before, I would buy a 9 and I had too much room for my toes but the width was OK. If I bought an 81/2 the toes were OK but my foot hurt because it was cramped. I will definitely order again!"
"newbalance Second pair.  Fit perfectly, comfortable, last long time."
newbalance I have purchased several pairs of newbalance Training shoes in fact brown as this pair numbers change but remain very comfortable to wear.
"newbalance Love the sneakers so much that I have been ordering the exact same ones for years and will continue to do so until/unless they do away with the style. If I catch it before that, I'll just bulk purchase them!"
newbalance Great shoes.  Really help with my plantar fasciitis. Not the best looking shoes though.
newbalance Product as described. Fast service and no problems.
newbalance Very comfortable. Perfect fit. Much easier to buy online than try to find them in stores because my size is always sold out.
newbalance Perfect for my husband whose feet are growing larger as he gets older.
newbalance Bought for my husband.  He's had this style and brand before and finds them very comfortable.
newbalance Wonderful shoe. This is my husbands favorite brand
newbalance returned and ordered 11 instead and they seem to fot.
"newbalance It fit about as expected, nothing that isn't going to get better with some wear.  In my mind, the quality of the shoe is good, I had no issues with that at all, it looked like typical NB quality.  newbalance is the only athletic shoe I've purchased for almost 15 years now."
newbalance Seems to be a bit wider than my 623 but still OK.
newbalance I have found this MX608 to be a good shoe for me.
newbalance Fits as always newbalance is always a great shoe.
newbalance This shoe was a little shorter than I thought it would be so I returned it for the same shoe but one half size larger. It was a very nice shoe and the replacement fit well.
"newbalance I buy these about every 6 months after I forget to change shoes before doing yard work and they turn brown or green.  They have always fit as expected, and feel good on my feet, and have reliable quality."
newbalance These shoes were comfortable from the minute I put them on.
"newbalance nice shoes, had to send back and get a size bigger"
"newbalance Nice shoes, good fit. Need more 4E sizes in different styles and colors."
newbalance For the price I am quite happy with this purchase
newbalance Love newbalance...Have worn them for many years &amp; now saving money purchasing from Amazon. T Y ;))
"newbalance A nice pair of sneakers, The price was right. I only wear newbalance shoes, They last longer that any shoe I have ever worn."
"newbalance I normally wear a size 8D but I have found with newbalance in general that an 8.5D fits very well.  While not labeled as such this is an extremely comfortable walking shoe.  I initially ordered the MK706 (at a much higher price) but returned them because the soles felt more like hard plastic than rubber as advertised.  They also squeaked.  The MX608V4 may not be as nice in appearance as the MK706, but are vastly more comfortable, as well as significantly less expensive."
newbalance So far so good. I will update after a month or so
"newbalance 3rd day, shoeloop broke off; tried to return but shoe was no longer available on Prime, and would've had to pay $15 more for the same shoe that broke in 3 days; no way!  Amazon, of course, more than took care of the whole thing which is why I always return here.  But the shoe, we won't be buying anymore. It is a comfortable shoes but it does look a little ""dumpy."" (ugly)"
newbalance Typical newbalance quality. I find them very comfortable and they fit well.
newbalance Could not complain about any fast accurate reasonable.
newbalance I always buy 4e 9.5 newbalance and they always fit loose as I need them too. Because of neuropathy. I had to squeeze into these. They are useless to me and went to goodwill.
newbalance I've only had them for a few days.  So far so good.
newbalance A little narrow. I need the wide sizes that don't come in all sizes.
newbalance Wore them today for the 1st time. They feel great.
"newbalance I have always worn this model this size , it is a great shoe and lasts a long time. High quality!"
newbalance Have never gone wrong with newbalance products!
newbalance Perfect fit and great price for a great look!
newbalance hubby loves these so i buy a pair every year.
"newbalance Great find, super comfortable and great price"
"newbalance I should have ordered ¬Ω size larger. My fault, the shoe is the correct size. Well made shoe."
newbalance As usual newbalance delivers a sturdy shoe with great support.
"newbalance I have been wearing newbalance sneakers for close to 20-years now and these, by far, are the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever worn.  My job consists of a lot of walking, which results to about 10-hours on my feet each day.  Even though I have only been wearing these shoes for 2-weeks, they still feel great when I wear them.  These shoes were definitely worth the price and I would recommend them to anyone who wants to feel like they are walking on air while wearing them."
newbalance Have had these shoes before and liked them enough to buy another pair. I also have these shoes in black and love them too.
"newbalance I use these shoes for work and I stand/walk approximately 14 hours a day, 5 days a week.  I love the color.  I love the design.  But... I find that I do have some foot issues if I continue to wear them over 2-3 months.  The support isn't there.  So for short periods of time, this shoe is good.  After 3 months or so, I need to switch to another shoe that has good support."
newbalance Has a solid cushion and appears to be made good.
"newbalance Been using newbalance for years since they sell a 4E fit, which I need.  They are comfortable and sharp looking"
"newbalance I have many other newbalance models. This one is the worst. Size is completely off (10.5), more than half an inch shorter than the same size for other NB models.. Very cheap looking materials. Only positive is sole, very comfortable. I tried the identical shoe in stores, same size, it had the same problem, too small, so newbalance is doing something wrong with this model .."
"newbalance Down here in Florida, a lot of folks don't wear socks. The insides of this shoe aren't very comfortable if you're going barefoot. They look a little dorky to me and don't have any ventilation in the front, but they seem well constructed. If you like the way they look &amp; wear socks, I think they'd be fine. I returned them, 5 stars to Amazon 'cause it couldn't have been easier."
newbalance They are the same as what we usually buy from the store.
newbalance Just as represented. Fits well and a good shoe.
"newbalance It's been around 2 months since I bought these shoes and I'm so happy I did! They fit perfectly, they're so light and comfortable. I always change the insoles (Dr. Scholls) when I buy new shoes (for work) though, because I walk a lot on a solid surface. I don't know about durability yet, but I'm very happy so far!"
"newbalance This is actually my second pair. The first lasted almost 2 years pounding the floor at a retail job. I have wide feet so the 4E fits me great! Wait staff, retail associates, look no further for the most comfortable and durable shoe. Even as they slowly fell apart at about month 20, my feet never started to hurt. Worth every penny!"
"newbalance been wearing this basically same shoe for 10 or 12 years. Love the ""4E"" size....I usually have 4 pairs of these: One pair new and relatively clean for ""dress-up"", one pair for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, another pair for Tuesday and Thursday (your feet don't stink if you rotate your shoes) and an old pair for ""lawn mowing"". I also have a couple pairs of rarely used Florsheims for weddings and funerals...."
"newbalance My husband LOVES these shoes! I only wear newbalance myself since both my Orthopedist and my Podiatrist said they are the very best shoes for your feet, your back, your balance, etc. They're right! Both my husband and I can wear newbalance shoes all day long without any foot pain and without our feet tiring out. The arch support is terrific as well. These are AWESOME shoes! You can't go wrong buying newbalance!"
"newbalance I have bought newbalance shoes for a long long time now. You know what to expect when you get them. The size fits great, the shoes you can wear them all day with no problem. Will never buy any other brand. When a Doctor recommends these shoes for my planters fasciitius  well that told me that these shoes were the best."
"newbalance Nice shoe, fits my wide feet and comfortable."
"newbalance they seem to run small, at least in my size 16"
newbalance My husband  love's  them.. He works 11 hours a day.. he said they are comfortable to work in and they hold up great.
"newbalance I wear size 14. newbalance is the best shoe for anyone out there &gt;13. they are comfortable and this particular shoe is perfect for long walks, which is what I use them for"
newbalance These shoes fit as expected.  I am a 10EEE.
newbalance These shoes were a birthday gift. They fit perfectly and he really liked them.
"newbalance Comfortable right out of the box, stylish too.  Actually made of real suede!"
newbalance Because of the oversized padding the shoe was extremely snug...had to remove padding and trim down so it would lay flat in the shoe.<br/>Shoe style and comfort is what i buy these for and completely satisfied with them now
"newbalance It's a very comfortable shoe for me.  It does the right things for me. Heel is low or just flat. This way my foot when walking has a lesser tendency for my foot to move forward in the shoe.  When my foot moves forward in the shoe my toes are the victims.  Less heel height, less forward movement.  If your want a good every day, all day walking shoe, this shoe is a keeper!."
newbalance Very comfortable fit. Glad I got 1/2 size larger!
"newbalance They wear like all newbalance that I have, Great. Bad part is they pick up a lot of dirt , Take off at door."
newbalance This used to be my husband's favorite shoe.  He bought them for years.  He no longer wants anything to do with the shoe and/or newbalance as the last 2 pairs fell apart within months.
newbalance this shoe fits so good it feels like your not even wearing a shoe ! and i love the memory foam insert .
"newbalance These are excellent shoes, got them for my husband.  Very well made, this model seems to run about a 1/2 size too small so we exchanged it for the some model 1/2 size larger.  He lives in newbalance training shoes like these all day every day (unless he needs to wear dress shoes) and they are great for everyday, walking, running and sports (he plays soccer).  Great shoes and a great shoe company!<br/><br/>Amazon made the exchange really easy and painless!"
"newbalance I love these shoes, they are comfortable and I would buy again."
"newbalance Great price! The two negative aspect of the shoes are as follow: first, the back end part by the ankle keeps hitting the back of my foot so you get some friction there and I suspect may result to a blister, and second but I could live with it is the top part of the shoe is not very flexible.  I have only worn it 3-4 times so maybe it needs a little more use/break-in."
newbalance Great shoes for work when you dont want to buy fancy shoes.
"newbalance I normally wear a 12D shoe and had a pair of the original 608 shoes and wore them for 6 years , loved them but now I can't get a pair to fit. I have tried a 13D a 121/2-2wide and nothing fits.  The new ones do not have an arch support like the orginal ones had.  I have already returned the 121/2 shoes."
newbalance Husband loves these shoes.  Always buys NB.
newbalance OK and very comfortable but won't hold up to workouts
"newbalance Black newbalance sneakers, they are awesome"
"newbalance Ordered a pair of these to be my ""everyday"" non-work shoes.<br/>They shipped promptly and fit comfortably (after a little breaking in).<br/>The price/quality ratio scores Aces as far as I'm concerned.<br/>Paired them with a set of the newbalance arch insoles and couldn't be happier!"
newbalance Fits well and good price in certain colors
newbalance Excellent support in an inexpensive but very comfortable shoe; ideal for my daily 5-mile walks. I'll probably buy a second pair so I don't wear out the first pair.
newbalance I received these shoes on time and box was labeled right. Then I toke them out of the box and they were not what the box said. Of course Amazon replaced them quickly and the second try were perfect  shoes fit and feel great. I swore I'd never buy shoes on line but I have been converted.
newbalance they are nice but i feel like my feet are burning after walking around full day in them
"newbalance Amazon Review......<br/>These NB 608V4 fit perfectly, and I like the design.<br/>I'm hard to fit. I have a history of physical issues with my right foot, and difficulty to fit. These shoes make it easy for me to lead my active lifestyle. I'm a teacher and love the outdoors. I can use these shoes in both worlds. Thank you...."
"newbalance Just starting to break in my latest pair of NB 608v4 shoes. The ones they will replace have nearly 1500 walking miles on them. While the soles are wearing thin, the uppers are still presentable enough to be worn in everyday settings.  I can't say enough good things about this shoe. For me, at least, it is well worth the money!"
"newbalance Hubby loves them!  I have been looking for these particular shoes for a while now, and they are very difficult to find in extra wide widths.  Very happy!"
newbalance Didn't look as good as expected or fit little large
newbalance Not sure my review qualifies since I purchased these for my husband. BUT this is the 2nd pair he has owned &amp; told me to order identical since he liked them that much so I would say they are very good shoes
newbalance Been wearing this same shoe for years.  A good shoe for farmers.
newbalance newbalance makes the best sneakers for my feet!
newbalance NOT THE EXACT MODEL I WANTED BUT THEY APEAR TO BE THE SAME OTHERWISE.  MUST BE THE NEW MODEL.  GOOD ALL AROUND WORK SHOE.
newbalance Excellent product.<br/>Excellent price.<br/>Excellent packaging.
newbalance i've got wide feet they fit great. they look great .no complaints.
"newbalance They have been incredible workhorse shoes, lasted much longer than most of the competition.  for some reason NB isn't making anything quite as solid and versatile any more."
newbalance The only sneakers my husband will wear.
newbalance newbalance has gone waaaay downhill over the past 30 years. Used to be far and away the best but now they seem to only be concentrating on professional sports equipment which is still top notch. Not so much for the regular consumer.
"newbalance Great shoes, fit and finish are perfect"
"newbalance Just what I was expecting, no surprises."
"newbalance my husband likes the shoe, the first time they were too small.<br/>They were exchanged  HASSEL FREE)<br/>the next pair arrived quickly and were a perfect fit.<br/><br/>great customer service"
"newbalance Comfortable shoe, but I ordered white with black and they delivered white with black blue."
newbalance I have very wide feet and these shoes fit perfectly. I have bought sever pairs and will continue to do so.
newbalance Super comfortable.  Light and very soft.
"newbalance Exactly as described as I've had others claim to be the size I need and yet they did not fit properly.  These are correct in size and after they are broke in, I'm sure they'll be fine."
newbalance Great product very consistent. These sneakers will never diappoint anyone because they are the same every time no corners cut.
"newbalance NOTHING LIKE NEW TENNI SHOES, THEY FIT AND FEEL GREAT"
"newbalance I have been wearing  newbalance hoes for the last 20 plus years. This shoe fits well and is comfortable. Provides right amount of padding.<br/>However, I find the thin extralong laces inconvenient. It is hard to get the same color regular laces from stores locally. Will appreciate if the vendor will mail replacement laces which dont reqyuire  double looping."
"newbalance I have had many pair of newbalance, men's training shoes over the years.  I have wide feet and their 4E sizes are very comfortable.  With newbalance I have been able to purchase my shoes without having to go to the store and try on many pair to find the right fit, and each pair I order fits as well as the last.<br/>I expect to continue wearing these same manufacturer &amp; style of shoes for many years to come."
newbalance The grey shoe is quite dressy and comfortable. It fit perfectly as expected. newbalance are very consistent with their size.
"newbalance This is 2nd pair of newbalance training shoes and is no doubt the best pair yet!  I have severe flat feet AND wear custom-made orthotics so finding any kind of shoe that's comfortable, supportive and accepts my custom-made inserts is a HUGE challenge.  Thank goodness for the newbalance company!! They absolutely excel at making great shoes for us flat-footers!!  So, if you're like me, don't hesitate in rewarding yourself with the best-made athletic shoe on the market!"
newbalance The size is great . Would buy them again
"newbalance Quick delivery.  Quality materials.  Acceptable price.  Fit great, no break in period.  Would purchase again.  Bought a pair of NB but not the style I normally wear from a retail store.  Had issues from the start arch was not right amongst other issues.  Regretted purchase instantly.  Looked up the 608 I normally wear took the info off shoe ordered them on Amazon and perfect fit like normal."
"newbalance My husband loves them, so comfortable."
newbalance My nusband has worn this brand of shoes for many years and he is very satisfied wit them
newbalance I'm a 14 4e. Where else you gonna get sneakers. Thank you newbalance. Love em.
"newbalance My husband has worn newbalance shoes for years. He has a very wide foot and they fit well. He walks approximately 5 miles each day at work, so comfort is paramount. These shoes fit the bill."
newbalance Second pair.  Love these shoes.  Come in 4E.
newbalance Love these shoes but they are a little bigger than expected. But I would not have exchanged them for a smaller size.
newbalance 4E width a little narrow but these shoes are really priced right for big sizes and seem comfortable so far. Im glad I went up a size from 12 to 13 as they seem to run a little small. Wear thin socks for best comfort.
newbalance My husband loves them. First time he has worn brown.
"newbalance I'm using these shoes to walk my dog.  We do about 3.5 miles in the morning and a shorter 1.5 miles at night.  Even with my orthodic inserts, the shoes are comfortable."
newbalance Fit great and very comfortable for walking
"newbalance I like the look of the shoes and the fit. However, the lining over the insole, came undone with the first wearing of them. Either I have to put it in place before putting the shoes on or I suppose, I could pull it out, but it seems my socks would most likely stick to the soles. I bought these for vacation. They never hurt my feet, even after hours of wearing them everyday."
newbalance great for people with wideset feet!
newbalance Somewhat disappointed with the newbalance MX608V4. They don't have enough arch support and they don't have enough cushioning inside to comfortably wear for long periods of time. I was hoping these would resolve some of my foot pain but no luck. Maybe I needed to buy a more expensive model of newbalance sneaker. I just think the cushioning and support in sneakers in general has gone down. The sneaker companies  cut costs and the people with foot pain suffer :(
"newbalance Moved to a ""new"" size, needed more room,  thanks!"
"newbalance Some time back, others and I had commented about declining quality of newbalance shoes. To my delight, out comes MX608V4. It has:<br/><br/> 1.) New, much-needed, additional cushioning. A little more cushioning would make my rating five stars.<br/> 2.) Fresh design and styling.  Very sharp appearance in informal social settings.<br/> 3.) Competitive pricing.<br/> 4.) Durability.<br/><br/>With these improvements, you may want to give them a second chance."
newbalance Excellent shoe! My knees feel so much better wearing these.
"newbalance great fit, good support, comfortable, not light, looks decent"
newbalance My husband loves these.  Great fit.  Always true to his size.
newbalance These were as expected.. arrived fast and were a great price.
"newbalance Good fit, comfortable, good value."
"newbalance Comfortable shoe, fits as expected"
newbalance Grandson was very happy with them.
newbalance Great shoes with a lot of support!
newbalance Excellent shoe for fitness walking
newbalance newbalance always work.  Always a good value
"newbalance Sizing has apparently changed since my last purchase of the exact same shoe about a year ago.  I've worn this same style for years, buying multiple pairs throughout that time. Although I still comfortably wear my 10.5 size from last year, both of the new pairs are about a  half size too small.  Rather than deal with multiple returns, I sent both pairs back and will have to try on in a brick and mortar store since the sizing now appears to be inconsistent."
newbalance fit is tight for the size  ordered
newbalance very comfortable shoes .. help my back when I walk
newbalance It is a bit wider than most 91/2 D shoes.
newbalance replaced my old newbalance sneakers
newbalance Good shoes that fit well are important
newbalance I wished I could get more than 4 months out of them. It's the 3 pair I bought. Anybody got any suggestions!
"newbalance Good shoe, bought them for work, did not need a breaking in time, so were comfortable.  But like most products these day not really build to last, but for the cost it will be ok."
"newbalance Great shoes for the price, and very comfortable. I am going to order another pair."
"newbalance The only shoes I can wear, you can not find wide widths is womens shoes."
"newbalance Got bleeding under toe nails wearing this shoe playing tennis few years back and didn't pay too much attention. Then the bleeding had gone after switching to a different shoe. Got a new 608V4 few months ago and started wearing it playing tennis and the bleeding started again under toe nails. However, to be fair, you get what you pay for."
newbalance Great Fit<br/>Love then<br/>Sam
newbalance Shoes look really nice on.  Good quality for the price.
newbalance Excellent product.  Timely delivery.
newbalance Very comfortable.  I love the memory foam insoles!!
"newbalance perfect fit, very comfortable, Nice casual look."
"newbalance Bought this to replace a previous pair that i wore out. Liked those, like these new ones."
newbalance Great shoes. Love them. Third pair.
newbalance I have been wearing newbalance 15 to 20 years now .. I buy a new pair every 6 months.. but these where small but the same size I have wore for years . I put them next to the pair I am wearing and they where about an inch shorter .
newbalance Love newbalance shoes they are very comfortable.
"newbalance these have been a great buy. 6 to 8 hour shifts at work, most on my feet and these have been fantastic. the memory gel inner soles (that I didn't even know it had) are very very comfortable. only issue so far is the feel of the laces, they feel thin too light  they are dyed to match the shoe but not the ""normal"" beefy feeling NB laces, these have a slick or slippery feel"
newbalance very happy with the sneakers but did not wear them yet saving them for good
newbalance Have a walking route at the post office. Great shoe!
newbalance This the only shoe he will wear.
newbalance Seems like a good quality shoe but runs too small. I've always worn a 10.5 but with this shoe my toes are touching the front of the shoe. I waited until after the return date to try them on because I still had some life in my previous pair. I would recommend trying them on right away.
"newbalance We love this shoe because it is one of the few that offer the extra, extra wide choices. My husband has arthritis and needs the extra wide widths. He also takes out the insole and puts in an orthotic. He was able to wear them all day the first time he put them on. We will be buying these shoes again and again. Thank you newbalance for making shoes that fit wide feet, we love you for it."
"newbalance Great work out shoes, good value"
newbalance Very nice and super fast shipping!
"newbalance I have purchased these before. I still have my older pair, and am using them for work. The new ones look good enough to wear on my gigs (I'm a musician) A very well made shoe, Very durable and quite comfortable. I have a wide foot and a high instep. newbalance sneakers are the only brand that I can wear, all the others 'grab' me somewhere, even if they are my size. I'll probably buy another pair in two years!"
newbalance Fits how I wanted but I did order a 1/2 size up.
newbalance my favorite sneakers and a great price
"newbalance get theses all the time, perfect fit and great feel"
newbalance I have a difficult time finding the right shoe for my big feet. This one is comfortable out of the box and is durable enough to last almost a year of daily wear on my feet. I ordered it before and was not disappointed. Time will tell how this recent purchase survives.
newbalance My husband bought 2 pair because he has different size feet. He is pleased with the width and comfort and can wear them all day without feet hurting.
newbalance Extremely light weight compare to others. I am completely satisfied üòä
"newbalance I really did like this shoe and had been wearing newbalance 608's for many years.  This version however, while looking similar, is much narrower throughout the shoe.  Held up to my pair of 608V3s it is almost 3/4 of an inch narrower throughout for the exact same size (91/2 D).  Not to mention the rubber on the sole seems harder with less give.  Going to have to find a new leather cross trainer.  newbalance is no longer the same."
newbalance very very comfortable fast delivery and looks nice
newbalance Always loved this athletic shoe. Its both a great shoe to work out in and it looks good just as an everyday sneaker. I have very wide feet and for years this newbalance model has fit me perfectly. Highly recommended.
newbalance Excellent shoe in extended sizes
newbalance always wear this shoe for work
newbalance A little tight for a 4E but ok
newbalance Nice light shoe will buy again
newbalance husband buys same shoe over and over
"newbalance Great shoes, great way to buy shoes."
newbalance Shoes fit very well. Expected a bit more comfort. Found it was odd that the insoles aren't attached to the inside of the shoe. They pull right out.
newbalance newbalance makes a great walking or running or training shoe. I just like them. Missed the last sale 9My Bad Waited To Long) but NOT this time. On sale its an even greater shoe. The extra wide (4E) fits right (For Me) so no walking with or squeezing into a narrower shoe. The memory foam also seems like it will work well for longer periods of wearing.
"newbalance Only worn once thusfar, but toes seem a bit squeezed."
newbalance And loves these newbalance .
"newbalance Neat looking shoe, fits well."
newbalance Great shoes at a great price.
newbalance Super comfortable and looks great.
newbalance Great fit for an old man's feet.
newbalance If you love newbalance. I love this one
"newbalance Great fit, nice and comfortable."
"newbalance Great Shoe, a little heavier then I expected."
newbalance Fit great. Feel great. Nice shoes overall!
"newbalance Nice shoes, came right on time, also about $20 savings."
newbalance Pretty good for a cheap shoe.
newbalance This style is a favorite. We buy at least a pair a year.
newbalance sure beats most of competion
newbalance It's newbalance says it all
newbalance Nice well made for the price
newbalance Good shoe for a great price.
"newbalance These are awesome shoes! Not only do they fit well, but that are well cushioned, have great tread, and they look great. They are more like suede leather and could work well as business casual shoes. Note on the fit: since I have wide feet (more like flippers actually), it's very difficult to find shoes that fit properly. I ordered 11 4E and like all newbalance shoes of this size, they fit perfect for me. Highly recommended."
newbalance I have purchased these twice before. They are great!
newbalance Not as comfortable as hoped.
newbalance These are my favorite sneakers. i have been wearing them for several years now.
"newbalance The shoes are fine, but I can no longer find narrow widths like I used to. I look through a half dozen or more sellers and nothing narrower than ""D"". Used to be able to find ""B"" widths. They have only been worn &lt;2 weeks and already both sides of the lace up areas (whatever they are called) are almost touching each other. PLEASE make narrower widths available."
"newbalance newbalance seems to have gotten back their quality.  Had a few pairs of same shoe in which quality was not there.  These remind me as to why I choose newbalance...great fit (it's about my 10th pair so I know what size to get), comfortable walking."
"newbalance I've always loved the way the newbalance last for my shoe size fits my foot. However, this pair seems to be just a tad bigger than my previous pair, which were labeled the same size and width. When I tighten the laces, it kind of scrunches up the material. However, they are comfortable and roomy for my toes. Seems to me the fit could be a little better like my last several pairs were."
"newbalance I got a 10 1/2 4E it felt a little larger than what I was expecting a new shoe to feel, I usually expect them to feel a little tight and loosen with wear(I guess called broken in) these felt good almost like wearing a cushiony slipper. I suppose if I tighten the strings better it would feel tighter, but I like the way it feels now."
newbalance Still wearing after months. Excellent wear and durability. They're 100% leather and look/clean nicely
newbalance Very nice sneakers fit well
newbalance great price for newbalance
newbalance Now to buy a couple more pair.
newbalance Shoe has fallen apart within 2 months
newbalance I love the shoes.. but I just bought a pair of them I paid close to $60 for him and now you have them on sale for 48 716?  I love the shoes all ordering again I have no choice but I could expect to be rebated or given credit for the difference being so dramatic from one week to the next week I will wait for your reply thank you
newbalance order same pair every time.
"newbalance Good shoes, comfortable fit."
newbalance The  sneakers don't feel like the real thing they feel like imitation
newbalance Love the comfort and arch !!!<br/>Good deal
newbalance This particular style of newbalance fits perfect. These are my 3rd pair.
newbalance Returned for a larger size
newbalance newbalance shoe are great
newbalance Shoes fit well. Comfortable enough to wear all day. Right foot is a little snug. As expected due to one foot being larger than the other.<br/>They work well with my FLOPSTOP. (a bungee cord used to lift my left foot) MS and DROPPED FOOT. I recommend the shoe.<br/>I saw pictures ware they fell apart. But how were they used???
newbalance This is my 5th or 6th pair of newbalance 600 Series in the last 20+ years.  I have had 623's and 608's.  Love them so much I just keep buying them.
newbalance I've been a newbalance customer for many years and I'm very pleased with this purchase also.
"newbalance The shoe tends to scrunch up when you tie the laces, which just looks ugly.  After a few months, the sole started to separate from the top.  Not the quality I've come to expect from newbalance."
"newbalance They are just what my son wanted.  All black, with no other color.  Fit comfortably out of the box!"
"newbalance Good fit, excellent quality, very good value!"
newbalance I was a little worry about ordering shoes off the internet even though amazon is great shoes can be tough to get the right pair . I have a pair of these already that I purchase at local retailer but they are a previous model and not in wide a version I kinda new how these would fit. So when I seen these I figure I would give them a try and there wonderful they fit they don't hurt my feet at all unless if the tong is clinch up but that is a easy fix.
newbalance Best quality of sneaker I have ever purchased.
"newbalance I bought the exact same shoes last year, exact same size and color and I like them.  I purchased this pair and they are too narrow and too short.  Both made in Indonesia."
"newbalance Great shoes, great price!"
newbalance I purchased these because I had the v1 version of these a few years ago.  So far they seem sturdy and I wear them as my primary shoe.<br/><br/>Soles seem sturdy. The insole is spongy (like a new shoe usually is). Good arch support.<br/><br/>I'd recommend these shoes.
newbalance I think NB is stepping up because these shoes right out of the box fit great feel great and look good! I have been wearing NB for years and the last pair didn't do as well as previous pairs but still better than competitive brands. I feel confident about this new pair but if they let me down I'll be back to update this review.
newbalance not as sturdy as desired
"newbalance Extremely comfortable, love the extra cushion.  Fits great.  I would buy another pair, when I need them."
newbalance Fit seems fine.  The construction seems better than the V2 version I had before.
newbalance Good product as expected
"newbalance Fit a little tight, but okay; everything was fine until fabric at heel frayed and developed hole, now show is unwearable for any type of walking or running; irritates the foot back heal area"
"newbalance Fit great so far,  as have only had them for a couple of days."
newbalance Fit is great- as expected. Delivered quickly.
newbalance I really like these shoes.  I will buy again.
newbalance newbalance seems to be the only shoe that has a wide fit for problem feet.  They are an excellent sneaker and they have model numbers so you can get the same shoe or the next model and stay consistent.
newbalance I was somewhat surprised when I noticed the price of the shoe as the identical shoe (608) which I ordered the day before was almost twice as much as the former shoe which has the same identical quality.
newbalance He's happy to I'm happy
newbalance My husband's favorite shoe!
"newbalance Great looking shoe, holding up well"
"newbalance Very comfortable.  A little hard to say on the arch support as I removed the (completely flat) insert that came with the shoe and wear them with my orthotics, but they fit and wear fine and my last pair proved durable.  My only complaint is with the length of the shoe strings.  Was there something I missed back in shoe-tying 101 that explained what to do with the extra inches that flap about and get stepped on even when I tie a clown-sized bow? Shorter strings to come"
"newbalance A great shoe--terrific value, performance and style."
"newbalance I purchased these to replace an older pair with the SAME model number.  (MX608V2)  Well, the V4 is crap. Not the same shoe.  The upper is synthetic, not leather.  The sole is lighter in weight, and of a different material that is less ""rubbery.""  If I hadn't worn them, I would have sent them back in a heartbeat."
"newbalance Wore the shoes 2 days, granted one was for an 8 mile walk. Still, I was surprised when I put the shoes on indoors and noticed theysqueek when I walk. Only the left heel squeeks, but it's bad enough that you can hear it when walking indoors. Outside the sound isn't as evident. I don't know if they squeeked when brand new, or if they squeek now because of the limited use."
"newbalance Typical newbalance all purpose shoe. Fit as expected.<br/>Updated review:<br/>After having these shoes for several months, and after having numerous newbalance shoes for many years, I am compelled to give an updated negative review. These shoes are only several months ole. The soles are coming off each shoe. In addition, the stitching on the top of the shoe is coming apart. I work in an office and these shoes are worn nearly every day. They are not overused or abused.  I am very disappointed in these shoes."
newbalance Perfect for my size 14 feet
"newbalance Good shoe, just too small."
newbalance Fits well and arrived in a timely fashion. Overall a good experience.
newbalance Good fit. Comfortable.
"newbalance I had a pair of these newbalance shoes that I bought at a department store. They were wearing down, so I ordered a new pair. I just ordered the exact same shoes that I already had, so I knew they would be exactly what I wanted."
"newbalance I had never ordered newbalance shoes (or any other walking or running shoes) online, so I did so with some anxiety.  However, I love these walking shoes.  I am in an urban area for 4 months working at a job that involves long walks.  I try not to use public transportation for anything under 1 mile.  I wear these shoes almost daily (unless a suit or business casual is required for a meeting).  I LOVE THESE SHOES!"
newbalance Love the look and the material
"newbalance This was the first time I have bought shoes on-line, but I have owned several pairs of newbalance shoes in the past. I was also currently wearing a pair that was nearly worn out, so I just ordered the same size and width I was wearing. The shoes arrived  in the time-frame promised. They were all laced up and all I had to do was remove some wadded up paper from the toe area of each shoe and put them on."
"newbalance My dad walks for miles every day and is on his second pair of these. He loves them, and they last him a long time. He's especially happy that they are suitable for all kinds of weather. I'll get him a new pair after these live out their life."
"newbalance They fit perfectly.  Fortunately I wear a perfect men's ""7"" and they fit well.  I have to buy via internet because I cannot find a ""7"" in any store."
newbalance Pleased with transaction.  No problems.
newbalance 92E l ordered and received.  Very comfortable.  Great for my daily walks
"newbalance My husband loves these sneakers. He dressed old school so these are perfect for him.  A lot of the other sneakers are too flashy for him.  Plus he's on his feet all day at work in boots so his feet are always sore and tired, but on the weekends he wears these and they are so comfortable."
"newbalance My feet are on the narrow side, so after reading reviews I figured the normal width would be my best bet. The length was what would be expected. As they are new and have had no time to see how they handle wear &amp; tear, I held them to 4 stars."
newbalance Fits and looks great.
newbalance I ordered wrong size
newbalance These shoes are actually for my husband.  He's been wearing this particular pair of newbalance for quite a few years now.  He has had a problem with a heel spur and these are the only shoes that give him relief.
"newbalance I usually wear a 14 in this brand, and I've purchased them many times. This particular style ran smaller. I wore them once and will have to return them and exchange for a 15."
newbalance Love newbalance Shoes.
newbalance Absolutely love these shoes. The only shoe I've found to fit my wide foot. I wear a 12 EEE. These are 4E so I've got a little extra room. This is my 4th pair of 608's. I usually wear them out in about 9 months of regular use.
newbalance I have the V2 version of this same shoe......to say that NB's quality control has gone down would be an understatement. The internal lining is already peeling apart.....laces are cheap....and the overall quality is a real step down.......on the plus side they are very comfortable. Overall I guess it's time to look at other brands and see what is available......I expected more from NB.
"newbalance I have been wearing these shoes for years for work, and now that I work on my feet for 10+ hours a night I've never been happier to have found these shoes. Comfortable, fit just right, and last me about 4 months where I average about 10 miles a night at work (which, full disclosure, is at one of Amazon's fulfillment centers). The only downside for me is they look like old man shoes, but I'll sacrifice style for comfort."
"newbalance It's hard  to find my size for the price at my shopping malls. For the price, and ease of purchase, well worth it."
newbalance These look and fit exactly as expected. Free of flaws and very comfortable.
newbalance Look good and feel good
"newbalance Perfect fit, very comfortable and supportive."
newbalance Not as good as the V1
"newbalance I've said it before and I will say it again, this is an amazing shoe! Not only is it comfortable but it keeps my husband's feet from turning to the sides...pronation I think it's called.  He wears these all day long while he does home remodeling. Only shoe  I have found that keeps him comfortable all day long! And along with that, and amazing buy!"
newbalance nice shoe so far only been wearing a few days
"newbalance the shoes are exactly what my husband wanted,"
newbalance I like my new shoes!
newbalance Great shoe at a reasonable price.
newbalance NB's Dunham shoes are far better fitting
newbalance Fit and feel great
"newbalance My husband loves his newbalance sneakers. He has an odd foot size and they are one of the only companies that make his size. Regardless, they look great and are made well and last him a long time. Great value on Amazon, we have Prime so he got them in two days and is super happy with them Extremely comfortable he said, feel and look great. If you have odd size or swollen feet or are a bigger person newbalance is definitely got you covered."
newbalance Very comfortable and sturdy.
newbalance My husband loves them fits great just what he wanted!
"newbalance This sneaker is the most comfortable sneaker I have worn in a while, and I have had Nike's and Reebok's.  The size  runs spot on and they hold up very well.  I have another pair I bought about 3 years ago somewhere else and they are still holding excellent.  I would definitely recfommend these to everyone."
"newbalance I used to have severe problems with my feet, but ever since my podiatrist recommended newbalance shoes 7+ years ago, I have not had any issues. That is why I am totally sold on the newbalance brand. I've purchased the last three generations of this particular model and I absolutely love them. They're extremely comfortable, well made, and reasonably priced, which is why I'll likely purchase v5 when it's released. In my humble opinion, you can't go wrong with any newbalance made shoe."
"newbalance I bought a pair of these for my husband a couple years ago and he loved them. They are comfortable and lasted him over a year, which is pretty good for him. I ordered him another pair and they only lasted 1 month, so I returned them, thinking it must be a fluke since the first pair were so good. They were exchanged promptly, but now the new pair is coming apart in the same place. The seams are coming undone after two months! I will not buy these again."
newbalance Good shoe for the price.
"newbalance These are a pale imitation of the 608v2 pair that lasted me for years.  The soles and arches are okay, but the uppers feel flimsy and cheap, and in the end, not much better than a canvas sneaker.  They don't provide structure around the foot, especially when moving laterally.<br/><br/>The quality of the uppers is similar to what you would find in any department store's house brand.  This is apparently what comes of reducing the price point from $120+ to $49.99.  In my judgment they're good enough for the gym if you're just using ellipticals and weight machines, but not good enough for running or anything requiring agility."
newbalance Great shoe as always. Been wearing them for years.
newbalance NB....THE VERY BEST
newbalance Perfect for my needs
"newbalance Price is ok, they fit as expected.  Delivered as on date promised.  Good experience."
"newbalance these were for my son, who needs a good supporting shoe. He walks a lot as a form of exercise.  He says they are very comfortable.<br/>He is a fan of newbalance.  I was very happy to find them on Amazon.  Our go-to shoe store no longer carries newbalance. The price was within our budget.  He also was complemented on the look of the shoe."
"newbalance I've used newbalance for years.  My last Black pair (MX 623) had this terribly annoying property of loud squeaking with each step on vinyl tile floors at work.  So much so that I had to avoid those office areas.  They also wore prematurely at the back cushioned heal support.<br/><br/>But these MX 608V4's exceed expectations, fit perfectly and NO SQUEAKS (I would have returned them otherwise).<br/><br/>I only wish NB would continue models so I could get these the next time."
"newbalance The shoes fit well. My feet said ""Ahh"" from the time I first put them on. This was the same experience I had with my previous v2 and v3 ones. The v4 ones are lighter than my v3 ones and have a different sole pattern. There are deep, crosswise grooves in the sole to make it more flexible. I'm curious to see how they hold up. The soles on my v3 ones delaminated  after I started using them as my yard shoes."
"newbalance Usually bye 626, these are just as comfortable and cheaper."
"newbalance I bought a pair in black specifically for a crazy week of stage and mic setting, rehearsals, recording, and performing.  LOTS of walking, running, and equipment moving.  Sunday night when it was all over, my feet actually felt good.  I ordered two more pair that night.  The leather uppers make a huge difference in comfort, and they look good enough to wear for business casual."
"newbalance shoes are comfortable, light and fit perfectly.  I will purchase them again."
newbalance My favorite brand and model of shoe.
"newbalance Perfect so far, just as expected."
newbalance Very comfortable
newbalance The shoes fix perfect . Thank you Amazon . You treat me good I will treat you good.
"newbalance he likes them, perfect"
newbalance Nice shoes. Rub the backs of my ankle though.
newbalance husbands favorite
newbalance Fit as expected.
newbalance It came as expected.
newbalance Fit nice . The only thing while not that important is that the shoelaces were extremely long. Had to cut them down. Also the laces were very tight on top of foot. I have to loosen them each time I wear them.
newbalance My husband loves the comfort and fit of these shoes.  I like the color as it goes with everything.<br/>The only thing I would change is to omit the tab on the back of the shoe as it interferes with the pant's leg often while the man if wearing them.
newbalance Wore out easily
newbalance Just what i always wanted.
newbalance Very good shoe.  I will buy this again.
"newbalance I love buying my shoes here. never any surprises, fit every time ."
newbalance Verey comfy and a great deal
"newbalance For what I paid for these, they're good shoes which hopefully will last me a while.  My last pair of NB shoes I bought on Amazon lasted a little over 2 years, but that included a couple of minor repairs, which is fine.  The fit nicely, not too snug or loose, and the memory sole is actually quite nice.  Depending on durability, I'd buy again."
"newbalance newbalance sneakers are the only sneakers that I buy.  They are extremely comfortable, durable, perfect arch support, and are great for standing on your feet all day."
"newbalance newbalance shoe sizes always run true, walk right into them with no break-in period required."
newbalance Had to return.
newbalance Great Product!
newbalance Love my newbalance
newbalance very comfortable
newbalance The shoes were returned.
newbalance Great shows for heal spur
"newbalance Getting a properly fitted sneaker is an individual preference for comfort since everyone's foot is different but I've been buying newbalance for many years now and find them to be a far superior fit compared to NIke, which I feel are usually way over priced and not worth the hype.<br/> In my opinion, newbalance are very comfortable and provide proper support and I wear them almost every day."
newbalance Always a great fit
"newbalance Good deal, good shoes."
"newbalance Nice shoe , but doesn't fit for some reason as shoes I've had over the years from the store (same shoe nb608) but somewhat tight ! But all in all I can live with it verse returning it . Thanks"
"newbalance The NB Men's MX608V4 is a great shoe.  I have wide feet &amp; bunions, so it is not easy to find a comfortable, sturdy shoe that I can wear right out of the box.  I ordered a 12.5 4E.  These shoes fit the bill.  I have worn them for 4 long walks (3+ miles) and my feet feel good.<br/>Very pleased with this purchase."
"newbalance It was a great surprise for my husband.  He has bragged already about the support, and comfort!"
newbalance So far so good
newbalance One of the best shoes
newbalance Birthday gift for my hard to fit Grandson..  GREAT fit!!
newbalance Love these. Very comfortable. Wear them all day.
newbalance newbalance has always been my choice because I can depend on the fit.
newbalance Well made but a bit narrow at the toe. Would be more comfortable a half size larger. I got an 11D.
newbalance Great Product
newbalance Very comfortable shoes.
newbalance Well pleased.
"newbalance I always loved newbalance shoes. But lately, every pair I have bought seems the soles come unglued after approx 6 -8 months.  Time to try a different brand as it gets expensive to replace shoes so often."
newbalance Exactly as described
newbalance Love newbalance and the extra wide makes it fit great.
"newbalance I answered the above questions but I have worn the 600 series for years. I also wear a prescription fitted orthotic with mine, which makes my foot even wider. These shoes are the only ones that I can find that fit my feet. I have to get a men's shoe to do that. I have bought &amp; tried other shoes &amp; my feet end up rocking &amp; my ankles end up turning. Not worth it to me."
newbalance These are my husbands favorite shoes. He has a lot of trouble finding shoes that fit his foot well and these are perfect for him. They are very good quality and last a long time.
newbalance This is the best shoes I have bought 2 times now and they feel so much relief for people with wide feet. Just check your shoe size before buying
newbalance I have always liked newbalance shoes and these are as good or better than previous pairs.
newbalance very good shoe
newbalance Great Price.
newbalance I bought these shoes for my partner.  He is using them for work. He loves them. The fit is perfect.
newbalance Comfortable.
newbalance You get what you pay for.
"newbalance These are nice trainers I always buy the same kind 608's I  bought them to replace the pair I have now when the time comes, I also have Black 608's too,"" love em "" their made well and hold up well for 2 or 3 years depending on how hard you are on them."
newbalance I like the color and how light they are. Very comfortable.
"newbalance I have an old pair of 608v3 that fit just right.  I have worn size 12d for the last 35 yrs and the last two pair of NB were somewhat small.  I am not sure why.  the first small pair was 623s and I thought that was why they were small.  So then I ordered a pair of 608's but only could get the v4.  They are small.<br/>Is newbalance now cutting their shoes smaller????<br/><br/>Thanks,"
newbalance Love this shoes!!!
newbalance NB do i need to say anything else
newbalance As promised
newbalance Good shoes.
newbalance Perfect fit
"newbalance I have ordered this exact same shoe in the past. Fits great, comfortable from the moment I put them on."
"newbalance Always order the same size and width. i could not wear these they destroyed my toes on my right foot. Back they went.<br/>I guess i wii\ll not be ordering newbalance anymore. this was the shoe i always ordered for the last 10 years.<br/>I guess things change. Sometimes, not for the better. I reordered Skechers and will try those instead."
"newbalance Perfect fit, right the first time. Good everyday walking shoe."
"newbalance wasn't perfect but darn close; was worried after reading reviews about these shoes not being as good in the past; seemed great to me; felt excellent right of the box with just a tiny new shoe feel along the big toe on the right foot, but i'm being picky as i was wearing my nicely worn-in rockport walkers to compare them to; i would rate these as 4.5 or higher"
newbalance Nice shoe. Fits great. Almost as good as my old 609's
newbalance Fits as expected.
newbalance my husband loves them thankyou
newbalance GOOD SHOES
newbalance Great shoes
newbalance Good shoe run small.
newbalance could be a five just need to have more time to see how long tey last need more time
newbalance great item
newbalance Maybe I need a 15
newbalance Great shoes great price
newbalance Good quality shoe at the best price on the internet.
newbalance feely nice!
newbalance Great pair of shoes love them
"newbalance Nice shoes, I really like them."
"newbalance this sneaker is narrow in the toe area, was actually squishing my pinky toe inwards, wouldn't buy these for myself again."
newbalance great fit
newbalance Very nice
newbalance Nice shoe
newbalance Fit is good
newbalance Love them
newbalance Nice looking shoe.  Good quality.
newbalance We love newbalance shoes
newbalance Nice shoes!
"newbalance Very comfortable, fit is excellent."
"newbalance While they were a bit too small when I put them on the first time, and even had some minor pain after using them for a couple of hours, they settled in nicely and now both fit well and I can wear them all day.  I believe they were slightly narrow when new, and a day of stretching cured that.<br/><br/>They are very well cushioned and comfortable."
newbalance Nice shoes
newbalance great way to buy shoes.
newbalance Fit well and fell good so far.
newbalance nice fit
newbalance fits well
newbalance This shoe perfectly fits my feet and satisfied with my purchase. Thank you.
newbalance Nice shoes
newbalance Perfect!
newbalance very nice
newbalance Great product!
"newbalance Great ,comfortable ,shoes 3rd pair this pair the toe was slightly more pointy than the first two pairs,these shoes are worthless as work shoes if you work any real construction job will not last more than a month but great shoes to chill in."
newbalance Good everyday walking shoe.Big fan of newbalance shoes.
newbalance finally a shoe that fits like the discontinued 1005 model.  NB is great for wider feet (4e) but many of the new models of tennis shoe have the right size marking but are not 4e like the 1005 they are much narrower..... Happy I made the purchase and will buy another pair in case they discontinue this too.
newbalance perfect
newbalance Wear at work and stand long hours.<br/>VERY COMFORTABLE!<br/>Recommended
newbalance Looks great and fit great. Using daily.
newbalance These look great and fit great. My husband loves them
newbalance They fit good and have good arch support.
"newbalance Typical newbalance show with good quality and sound stability. The shoes fit great is stylish, exactly as I have come to expect from newbalance. I have found Amazon's price are the best around. I used to buy my shoes at a newbalance store, however; the price is normally twice that of Amazon for the exact same shoe. Granted it takes a couple of days for ordered shoes to be delivered but great quality at an even better price is well worth the wait."
newbalance Fits snug between toes and top of sneaker.
newbalance Great shoe and price
newbalance My husband absolutely loves these shoes.  He wears them as his work shoes with his khaki pants. He has very long and wide feet and we find that newbalance are the only shoes that we could order online and know without a doubt they would fit his foot. The shoes are extremely comfortable and I will be ordering him another pair that he can wear on the weekends soon.
newbalance Good shoe
"newbalance Supposed to be exactly the same shoe as others of this model I ordered. For a reason I can't pinpoint it makes upper right foot sore by putting pressure on midfoot. The other shoe, on the left foot, irritates because there's no way to position the tongue so it doesn't rub on front of ankle."
"newbalance Great fit, quick delivery, good price.  Love newbalance."
"newbalance I don't like the gel inserts;  I replaced them with a regular pair from the drugstore and the shoes are much more comfortable.  If I kept the gel inserts in, I'd have to go up one size because of their thickness."
newbalance Nice Product...Thanks!
newbalance These shoes are very comfortable and look great.
newbalance Just got my pair a few days ago and they fit and feel great.  They offer great support without being to heavy. This is also a great shoe if you have any problems with your heels. I put my gel heel insoles in and it was like walking on air.
newbalance Met my expectations!
"newbalance I have been wearing newbalances for casual use for the past 15 years. Love the shoes, great fit, stylish and good price. Do I need to say anymore?"
newbalance comfy
"newbalance They are comfortable to wear in many environments including exercising, walking or casual activities.<br/>I would probably buy them again as they lasted reasonably well."
newbalance Great.
"newbalance I had a pair with a similar model number years ago and they were very nice shoes. I've bought several brands since, and even another style of newbalance, but none matched my old ones, so I found these and ordered them. They fit great and feel great. They are Cross Trainers, so they might be a little heavy if you are into running, especially long distance, but for normal wear, they are good."
newbalance good product
newbalance Great!!
"newbalance Replacement for previous NB Black Cross Trainers. These are much smaller in 10.5 2E than previous shoes. Also, the sole of these is too hard. Other shoes had a soft gripping sole. This is hard and noisy. Similar to walking on a board. Would definitely not buy again. Simply wish I could replace the old ones. Still might with a little super glue and black silicone.<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/New-Balance-Men-s-MX608V4-Training-Shoe-Black-10-5-2E-US/dp/B00IYAVP34"">newbalance Men's MX608V4 Training Shoe,Black,10.5 2E US</a>"
newbalance fit is good
"newbalance Great support and cushioning, the way newbalance shoes USED to be made. I'm about to order more in different colors. These are men's shoes, but if you order a size or so smaller, they work well for women. They have more support than women's shoes, last longer, and are much wider and more comfortable."
newbalance This is the only shoe my husband will wear. Fit is always spot on and comfort is wonderful. Very good shoe.
"newbalance I have bought these before ,very comfortable,I work in a warehouse ,on my feet all day walk alot great shoe"
newbalance Very comfortable shoes
newbalance this is a nice product &amp; it does fit as expected.  Nice service &amp; looks cool!
newbalance nice I like them
newbalance quality shoe
newbalance Very comfortable.
"newbalance I've been a long time newbalance user (going back to the 1970s) and I have nothing but good things to say about the MX608V4.  Excellent product, wears well and is very comfortable."
newbalance perfect
newbalance newbalance is the best
newbalance Love them.  Perfect fit
newbalance cool
newbalance Great shoe!
newbalance Shoes didn't even last a year before they started developing a small little hole near my toes. I've own another pair of newbalance shoes just like these that held up for 2.5 years before dumping them. I do security work so I do quite a bit of walking but I've never had an issue like I did with these. Never buying another pair of newbalance's again!
newbalance Very comfortable right out of the box.
"newbalance Great shoe , excellent quality and comfortable"
newbalance Good
newbalance They are great shoes--very comfortable; I wear them almost every day.
newbalance Good shoes!!!!!!!!!&amp;
newbalance Fits perfectly and looks great.
newbalance Will reorder when I wear them out in a couple of years or more.
newbalance comfy
newbalance They were labeled size 11 but appeared to be a half size to small. I returned them
newbalance great shoe of equal quality.
newbalance all perfect. Happy customer!
newbalance I am glad I read the reviews and ordered a half size larger than what I usually buy. These fit my husband perfect! He wears them every day to work in and it's very important that he has comfortable well fitting shoes. I was cautious about buying these because he has always worn the 608 which is no longer made. These are a great comparison to the 608.
newbalance I have always been a fan of newbalance and these do not disappoint.
newbalance I've only worn these on two occasions for about two hours each but very pleased about the fit and the excellent cushion that it provides.
newbalance Great price. The fit is fine. My only complaint is that the shoelaces are of the thin flat type that would not stand up to athletic competition for very long.  My other pair in a different color scheme that I bought previously had the rounder thicker laces.  Those sneak's did cost slightly more though.
newbalance Very Good
newbalance Not as padded as my older 608V2's/608V3's. Had to work the ankle area to loosen up the material. Not sure if the foot bed insert is comfortable or not yet. Am now trying heaver Costco socks to see how that improves the feel and fit. Don't get the sense there is much of an arch support BUT the shoes look great. If these V4 break in and end up being comfortable I will purchase another pair. Price was excellent.
"newbalance Excellent exercise shoe . Great just plain  ""ole"" walking. My favorite shoe !üòÅ"
newbalance This is the second time I suspect I got counterfeits from Amazon.  These never had the same feel as the newbalance I have been getting for several years now.
"newbalance I have some nagging planters fasciistis and these shoes didn't help that at all. I ended up buying a Powerstep insole, and when I removed the newbalance insole, I was amazed at how thin it was and how little support it had.  I didn't expect it to be as good as the Powerstep, but it was so insubstantial I was shocked.  There is almost no heel or arch support in the shoe.  I expect newbalance to be a quality product but the insole is utter junk."
newbalance good fit
newbalance :)
newbalance Great seller.  I love newbalance.  They fit my foot well and last a long time. Thanks!
"newbalance I am a woman, but I have been buying men's shoes because it's hard to find women's shoes wide enough.  I ordered these shoes because I bought a pair at a local shoe store that fit my wide feet and decided I needed more.  I'm very happy with both pairs.  I like the suede exterior because it looks a little dressier than a regular athletic shoe, and the colors aren't eye-popping day-glo.  They are comfortable enough to wear all day."
"newbalance Very comfortable...<br/>I have wide feet and it has always been challenging to find a comfortable shoes that fits, even when I shop in-store. This was the first time I order shoes online and I'm very satisfied with my decision. I measured my foot size with a Brannock device and placed my order; I received the exact size, and it's a perfect fit."
"newbalance My husband is on his feet at work all day, and luckily he can wear casual shoes.  I have been buying NB for myself for years, so I bought these for him, and his feet are tired, but who can be on their feet for 9 hours a day and not have tired feet.  He likes them, and knows, that any other shoe for his job, and he would be limping at the end of his work day."
"newbalance Working 10 hrs a day standing I haven't encountered any major issues with this product, however within a couple of hours the shoes feel heavy. By this i mean the shoes are not made for long-term wear and should only be used for short term exercise/activities. Otherwise, a good shoe. Just wouldn't wear it all day."
"newbalance Comfortable right out of the box. The size is near perfect for me. I wear 10.5 2E and these were the right size. I just got these a few days ago, so I can't comment on their longevity. I will update this review as I am going on vacation with these and plan on doing a lot of walking. So I will see how well these hold up."
newbalance Shoes were way too small. I've been buying newbalance for years.  Never had a problem before. These sneakers are awful.
newbalance I've purchased these before and they are the same great comfortable fit.
newbalance Seem to wear out pretty quickly
"newbalance Great shoes, at least for my feet!"
"newbalance The fit is slightly small for me, primarily in the instep.  The soles are a ""sticky"" and non-slip, though my Merrills are a bit better.  These are almost ""dressy"" enough to be mistaken for formal unless you look closely.  If I need another pair I will order one-half size larger."
"newbalance We tried a pair on 20 years ago. We order online the same size always NB just slightly different style. Fits always the same and comfort to the foot and pocket. My husband wears a 4E super wide shoe. Other shoes seam bust, he still has his last pairs for the last 5 years for work/play/whatever."
newbalance Not as good as the 626 that is a great shoes.  My back hurt and my toes rubbed together.  I work in a auto shop and stand/walk 10-12 hours a day.  Wish I could find the 626 which held up very well and helped my feet and back.  Nike monarch are a good sub but squeek a lot.
newbalance Good
"newbalance Not even a year old, wear 1-2x a week casually, stiching coming out, not very happy with it. Not sure if quality issue, still have an old pair that is 7 years old."
newbalance The shipment was excellent.  It was sent as expected. The shoes fit perfectly.
"newbalance Finally received my 608's today, they are the best fitting training shoe on the market.  I have wide feet and newbalance never fails to fit and feel comfortable.  I hope they never stop making this shoe.  The styling is understated and design just right, not too flashy and doesnt look like its for my grandpa, I just love them."
newbalance Anything newbalance puts out is a guaranteed perfect fit. I bought the 608s for my dad's birthday. He tried them on and never took them off. He loves them. newbalance knows what to make!
"newbalance Only shoe I've worn for several years. Hold up well, good for my feet."
newbalance Like the look and extremely comfortable!
newbalance I would like to see the 608v1 brought back.  The 608 series sneaker is getting cheaper and cheaper.  I would only buy them at 60 percent off next time.  Maybe i will wait for 80 [percent.  Its not worth the money.  I bought a schechers work shoe yesterday that had better quality and was cheaper.
"newbalance Hard to find shoes in my size, but these feel good after short break-in. I'd get them again."
newbalance good yard shoes for me.  tried to buy another pair as a backup but not available in my size.
newbalance It's a great pair of shoes.  Just what I was looking for and at a great price.
newbalance So far I am pleased with the sneaker as this is my third pair purchased in a three month period.  I was very disappointed in your 623 model and would never order them again after many years of being pleased. I don't know what changed but if this one changes I'm done with newbalance for good.
"newbalance These are just like the MX608V3 shoes I used to buy V3 before they changed to V4. If you like the V3, the V4 fit just like them."
"newbalance Comfortable, hold up quite well to all-day daily wear, and are actually wide enough for my giant flipper-feet. I'd say the only downside I can find is that the insoles wear out faster than the rest of the shoe, and you'll likely want to replace them about halfway through the life of the shoe to maintain decent arch support."
newbalance Really like these shoes. I have very wide feet and a high instep so it's very hard to find shoes that fit and ate comfortable. These shoes meet that stamdard. Very satisfied!
"newbalance Bought for my husband who is on his feet all day. He normally doesn't say much about shoes, but LOVED these so much that he told me to order a second pair to have when these wear out !!!!"
newbalance OK!
"newbalance newbalance makes the best shoe in my opinion, My husband and myself both wear newbalance.  they have a good snug fit but not to tight.  They are light on your feet and don't weigh me down.  They could work on arch support a little but with a pair of spenco arch support insoles they are the best shoe I have worn."
newbalance I bought these based on my liking another pair of NB Walking shoes. BIG Mistake after wearing only 12 times the heel is falling apart and fabric has worn through and digging into my heel I meant to return last week but I missed th return window by 6 days...  What garbage  Didnt realize newbalance quality so inconsistent
"newbalance Great shoes, great service"
newbalance love them
"newbalance These are replacement Yard shoes , all leather and easy on the wallet they are great for working around the house when boots are too much hassle"
newbalance I like the newbalance 608.  It is light and comfortable and fits my narrow feet well.  I use it as my exercise walking and jogging shoe and as my everyday shoe.  My last pair of 608s lasted a long time and I hope these will too.
"newbalance Well made and comfortable, although apart from the cosmetics of the style, I can't see the difference between these shoes and NB Mid626K2. I have U.S. Size 16 feet, and have found the Size 17 shoe to be a good fit."
"newbalance Fit was spot on, comfortable right out of the box.  Only complaint is the inserts were a bit too long and they didn't lay flat."
"newbalance This was a very comfortable pair of shoes from the time I first put them on. I wore them all day. Before my purchase, I read the star comments about size. I normally wear an 8D.I ordered 8, 1/2 D because comments suggested ordering a half or full size larger than my normal size. I do quite a bit of Amazon shopping, and I tend to trust the comments by most folks."
"newbalance I already had a pair of the exact same model number and size so I didn't expect any issues.  As I expected, they fit fine.  Delivery was prompt and as promised, and pricing was competitive with other alternatives.  They arrived clean and damage free so I am a happy customer."
newbalance have purchased this shoes many times and always fits from day one is comfortable.
newbalance Very good shoes. Fit good as expected and will buy another pair.
newbalance Have worn them before and like them just fine.
newbalance always a great product
"newbalance They are shoes, they fit, they didn't bite"
newbalance I bought a pair of newbalance shoes and I wasn't thrilled about the quality but for its price I was fine and I ordered  another pair a half size smaller but the same width and when I tie  the second pair it bunches up in front by the toes and its embarrassing to wear them I'm  very disappointed  about this and I hope it reaches the right viewer(s).
"newbalance Received this item on January 6.  By January 25th, the fabric around the upper shoe string hole on the left shoe was coming apart.  I've never purchased newbalance shoes that started falling apart so quickly.  This is my go-to brand for athletic shoes and am severely disappointed in the quality.  I have pictures of the issue, but do not see a way to post a picture to this review."
newbalance I have been ordering newbalance most of my adult life.  My back has been great ever since I started wearing them.  I do not see myself ever switching.
newbalance Great shoe
newbalance Great shoes. I had to try many before I found them.
newbalance Sneaks fit well ....Just wish they wouldn`t make their laces so long
"newbalance My son has worn NB for several years. They are comfortable, look good, true to size,and are sturdy shoes. He is very hard on shoes and NB  holds up to the heavy use. I bought two pair for him. The price was very reasonable. They look good too. I would recommend these shoes."
newbalance Shoes started out nice and very comfortable to wear.  3 months later the outside of the shoes started to tear and peel off from just general walking.  This started on the right shoe and now another month in and its starting on the left shoe as well in roughly the same spot.
"newbalance Bought as a back up shoe. I usually have a have trouble finding comfortable walking shoe that fit my high instep/wide feet. After finding a white pair of 608's at Farm and Fleet, was glad to find a other white &amp; blue shoe. Please note: These shoes, that fit me best, are one size larger than those previously owned. I'm also a senior."
"newbalance I only buy and wear newbalance 608's as my everyday shoe, I've been wearing the 608's since version 1 and I won't wear another shoe for all day use.  I buy the EE or the EEEE and they fit perfectly for my wide feet, they are comfortable, long lasting and I know they will fit great.  A great shoe for a good price."
"newbalance I wear 9.5 3E and have for many years. Recent newbalance purchases have had variable size toe boxes, some OK, some too tight. Went a size higher after returning original order this time and still too tight. Unsure where to go now for athletic shoes, but no longer trust NB quality control."
"newbalance I'd pretty much worn out a pair of previous-generation MX608s, so I thought I would replace them with a new pair. These are the same size, but feel larger. Nothing a set of insoles won't fix. The new pair is lighter-weight than the old. I like that, but hope it won't affect the durability."
"newbalance I have purchased this shoe before, and this pair is as comfortable as the others.  My only complaint is that there is a dark line on the top of the toe area on the right shoe.  I looks like an ink pen mark, about 1/4"" long.  Not enough to make me return the shoes, but I didn't expect a blemish on new shoes."
newbalance spot on.. fit great..
newbalance Very Comfortable and I can wear them all day without them becoming a bother.
newbalance Fit just like I expected. The only downside is that the laces stretch out.
newbalance Sizes vary too much to get these online.  Had to return them.
newbalance very nice walking in them.
newbalance I have bought this same shoe for years. They are good everyday shoes. Very comfortable. And the  brand comes in various widths which is good for me. Not meant for running.
newbalance The best and most comfortable shoes.
"newbalance My husband has flat wide feet and when these shoes say that they are a 4E, that is what he got. The shoe is nice and wide and do not over flex out the sides when he steps. Very satisfied and they also have a removable inner sole to place your own custom insoles."
newbalance Husband loves these shoes.
newbalance Fit as they should. Arrived when expected. Very comfortable.
newbalance love them
newbalance love the item
newbalance Great product
newbalance Luckily I ordered a half size bigger than my present shoes or they would not have fit. I ordered some Nike at the same time and these are much better shoes.
newbalance Comfy. Good fit. Used in healthcare setting.
newbalance good quality shoe
"newbalance Haven't worn the shoes yet, but have had several pairs of these shoes and they wear well. They are great shoes!  Wish the 608's could be in the stores again."
newbalance They fit as expected and are comfortable. A good value for the price. Amazon Prime delivered really quick even though I hadn't requested expedited delivery. The were delivered to my home on a Sunday. Go figure?
newbalance Fits perfect
newbalance Love these sneakers. Extremely comfortable.
newbalance Good shoe.  Comfortable for all day.  My second pair.
"newbalance Topmost outer eyelets (yes, both shoes) tore open after several months of occasional use.  Shoe fits fine, as other NB products have in the past.  Never had this happen to me on any other shoe I've owned.  I will still consider NB products as I have a wide foot and NB is one of the few brands to make shoes to fit me, but this was a disappointment."
newbalance husbands favorite casual shoe.  hard to find in any local store in the wider size...added it to his 'amazon wish list' and was part of his birthday presents
newbalance nice cushy feel love wearing them.
"newbalance I liked the previous pair of shoes that were 9.0 3xwide.  These are 8.5 3xwide.  Perfect fit, love 'em!"
newbalance Love these. wear them everyday to work
"newbalance These are really comfortable shoes that I can work out in or wear to work, and they easily accommodate my custom orthotic insoles.  They seem to have a little more heel cushion than a lot of flatter running shoes that I've tried, which helps with the plantar fasciitis. I've been a fan of newbalance shoes (for the most part) for a while, and these shoes help reaffirm that confidence."
newbalance I developed Plantar Fasciitis in one foot sole. Reading about about causes and cures noticed that old worn out trainers which provide poor arch support was a possible cause. I dumped my old trainers and bought these and a pair of Crocs. Both are very comfortable. Now I have to figure out how to heal my Plantar tendon.
newbalance They seem a bit small and tight. I have the same size sketchers that I think are more comfortable but they also have some issues. Time will tell if these will be better after some break in. At this point I'm somewhat disappointed but will keep them as I don't feel it's worth the effort to send them back.
newbalance I always have trouble finding mens size 8 2E width in stock in the stores. I bought these to replace an aging pair of 608s. Pretty happy with the fit although there could be more arch support. I wear them all day most days which includes ~30 min on the elliptical and ~60 min neighborhood walk. I expect they'll hold up as long as the prior pair ... about a year.
newbalance I have bought these same shoes for years because they fit like they were made for me and they last beyond expectation.
newbalance Have bought newbalance for years but feel quality has declined...last few have not held up well...we'll see how these go
"newbalance I purchased a pair of the identical shoe @2 yrs ago. Being on my feet daily, I needed a good pair of shoes that would hold up, and these fit the bill. I have the hardest time getting comfortable shoes. So when I find them,I stick with them. This pair feels just the same as my last pair did on day one. Very satisfied"
newbalance Good fit and comfortable.
newbalance Just what I wanted.
newbalance These are great shoes. I've ordered them before and they clean up so easily. Just a little Murphy's oil soap and you're good to go.
newbalance I have purchased newbalance shoes for several years. I know my size according to thier standard. My podiatrist told me they are the best shoe design for my feet. I agree completely. These shoes are very comfortable and hold up very well given normal care. I'm very happy to discover I can buy them through Amazon. The price here is better that through brick and mortar stores.
newbalance Very comfortable sneaker
newbalance These shoes have great support and fit perfect on me. These shoes will last years if taken care of. Well worth the cash.
"newbalance The newbalance MX608V4 Training Shoes (for Men) are kind of a lackluster when it comes to heavy duty usage. I can understand that the majority of people who wear these shoes are not consistently walking around. They are, however, designed for those who stay on their feet (not to be confused with actually walking/running). I want to say that they're comfortable for those who would have to stay on their feet for a while due to work-related activity, but definitely not a pair of shoes that you'd wear if you're frequently walking/jogging/running. I've had these shoes for less than three months (received on November 9th, 2015) and I've already gone through three insoles. I walk anywhere between 3-8 miles a day (sometimes 20 miles, depending on whether it's a weekend or not); so, I do understand that I'm putting tremendous stress on these shoes.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>----------<br/>They're pretty bad looking when you think about ""fashion shoes""; but, for someone who just needs something to fit on their feet and you're not worried about the fashion aspect of it ... these shoes should pretty much fit that requirement. They are quite comfortable while standing in one place for a few hours (with minimum walking range). For the robust and active person, these shoes are not going to last. My first insole was used after a week of wearing them (as I noticed that the ones inside the shoes were already lifting up and nearly falling out). The second was only a month later, due to the fact that there wasn't enough support in the shoe itself to keep the insole from taking the blunt of the stress. My third (recently put in last week) insoles were put in for the same reason as the last. They're good shoes as long as you don't intend on doing much movement on them.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>----------<br/><br/>- Comfortable. (Even when they're in a state of nearly being dead, they're still tolerable with a good insole)<br/>- Fit is as expected. (newbalance tends to add a little bit more ""width"" than other companies when ordering extra wide shoes, so just keep that in mind if you're kind of ""in-between"" width sizes)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>----------<br/>- Horrible looking (these are some odd looking shoes from newbalance; seeing as they've made many others that have similar purposes but look significantly better)<br/>- Not long lasting (while no shoe is going to survive under heavy usage, these seem to have a lesser build quality to them than most shoes of the same design purpose).<br/>- Poor build quality (as other reviewers have mentioned, these shoes will start to fall apart fairly quickly if you don't keep an eye on them; even without the additional stress - you'll find that the seams come loose or the insole tears away easily)<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I had to give them two stars. I'm not too keen on them because of how poorly designed and built they were; but, I do understand that they will be fine depending on what your expectations are."
"newbalance Purchased for my 13 year old son.  In boys he was wearing XW, but now that he is in men's sizes, the Wide is sufficient.  These appear to be put together well.  The navy is very dark, almost black, which is what it appeared on my computer.  A tad expensive, but not a lot of NB options in the wide that are not white."
newbalance Great shoes
"newbalance I put 'yes' for good arch support.  However, I still use additional support since I have plantar faciaitis. I think the arch support is adequate for normal feet, but not spectacular."
"newbalance Already a fan of newbalance MX (Cross Training) athletic shoes.  Usually wear their top of the line fitness shoe to work out because of their superior support but wanted a less expensive everyday shoe.  These look great, fit great and have the same generous size profile of my training shoe.  Good quality at a reasonable price.  Recommend."
newbalance comfortable but tight.
"newbalance The inside heel of these shoes have ripped after only 2 months, causing painful abrasions/blistering to the back of my heel.  I've generally had great experience with newbalance, but this particular brand has degraded very quickly.  Very unhappy.  Avoid these shoes."
newbalance newbalance makes the best sneakers.  I have a wide foot and can't wear any other brand as comfortable as these.
newbalance Fits my wide foot as expected. No defects. I have no idea how durable they will be.
newbalance Fits right and looks good.
newbalance best shoes and comfortable.
newbalance Great shoe
newbalance so far so good
newbalance good to wear
newbalance fits good like it
newbalance This is my 2nd pair. Love them.
newbalance second pair I bought. First pair lasted over two years and still going. I get the 4E wdth.
newbalance Very comfortable sneakers.
newbalance Wasnt sure about the fit before i got em. Fits well. Definitely gonna stick with them. Holds up well so far.
newbalance Have been a fan of newbalance for quite some time; shoes are wide enough.
newbalance I would prefer blue instead of black on the non logo trim.
newbalance great
"newbalance My husband has purchased at least 4 pair of newbalance sneakers from Amazon, true to size and saves going to the mall and then not finding your size!!"
newbalance Love these shoes
newbalance Love these shoes.  They are great for my flat and wide feet. Have been buying newbalance for several years. Never disappointed.
newbalance Comfortable great for walking
"newbalance newbalance comes in more 1/2 sizes, and additional widths than any of the major brands. Also, the insert comes out easily if you wear orthotics, and you need to make an easy change. (cheap sneakers glue them in place). ... Joe Prete"
newbalance Guess I expected a higher arch but the shoes are very comfortable.
newbalance nice
newbalance Great wear no problem
newbalance It is comfortable and fits well.
"newbalance I thought they would be roomier , a little too tight"
"newbalance The shoes are great and the inserts are an added plus. The minor complaint is that the shoelaces are extremely long and I had to cut about two inches off of them since they would be easily stepped on, other than that they were a step up from the NB 409's I was currently wearing."
"newbalance Tennis shoes are pricey, but good quality"
newbalance A very comfortable pair of training shoes
newbalance Needed these for work and they fit as expected.
"newbalance Great shoes, great price! I have been wearing newbalance shoes for a few years and they have never disappointed me. For the price, they're the best."
"newbalance I've been buying newbalance walking/training shoes for 20 years or more.  I can depend upon them always to fit perfectly and require no breaking in.  My only gripe, if you can call it that, is that every now and then I must search to find my shoe when newbalance changes the model number.  But I always succeed, and it's worth the small effort."
newbalance Love the look of these sneakers for my husband. Great for casual Fridays at work and comfortable to wear all the time.
"newbalance Fit as good as the previous newbalance 608.  Nice to be able to buy on line, didn't have to go to several stores to shop size and price."
newbalance Great shoes. Will buy again
newbalance good product for the money.
newbalance Perfect! Great shoes... Thanks!
"newbalance I purchased these to replace a worn out pair of the same shoe, this time I chose a different color as the selection was much greater buying through Amazon. The last pair I had held up great and I still have as a back up pair so I hope I will have similar results with this pair."
newbalance I've been buying newbalance for years . Great shoe
newbalance Good
newbalance The sneakers were perfect.  I ordered them for my son for his job where he's on his feet all day.  He loves the.  He says they are very comfortable.
"newbalance Expedient delivery, clean and fresh"
newbalance Good basic shoe but need to buy your own insert as the one provided is thin and flimsy. Need a little more support for the plantar area.
"newbalance What can I say. I love newbalance. They have become my favorite, go-to, athletic shoe over the last few year. They last a long time, even with daily wear, sometimes all day wear. I choose cross trainers because they are very good at multiple things - walking, working out, informal yard play, just kicking back in comfortable shoes."
newbalance My second pair great shoes
newbalance Very comfortable.
"newbalance Runs small.  In previous NB training shoes like these, I have worn size 12, 13, 13.  The size 12 was a bit short in the toes, but the 13's were ample in the toes.  The size 13 I order in this shoe this time was definitely short, similar to the previous size 12.  I had to return them for a size 14, first time in my life for a size fourteen."
newbalance Nice
"newbalance I love newbalance Sneakers, the only issue I have finding them are pricing and availibility. Due to my wider feet, I'm resigned to get typically black or white shoes exclusively. Now I can breath easy. I can now find reasonably priced shoes in more than just a black or white in my size. Oh and it don't hurt that these shoes actually do fit."
newbalance They are very comfortable
"newbalance I have worn a few different NB shoes and like these quite a bit. It seems to measure the same as the other (9.5) NB shoes I have bought but it seems to be just a tad bit wider than other NB medium-width shoes. Maybe that is because it is suede leather instead of the usual material. The shoes are comfortable, although not as supportive as other shoes I have bought but there is plenty of room for aftermarket arch supports if you need to buy some."
newbalance Love newbalance as they come in wide widths that fit my feet.
newbalance perfectly good fit...
"newbalance These started out as a very comfortable pair of shoes that lasted for 10-12 hours a day.  I received them on Oct 1, 2016 and the insoles have worn down to the point of discomfort by Jan 11, 2017.  Roughly three and a half months.  I have replaced the insoles and expect the shoes to last six more months."
newbalance Nice
newbalance Great for all day on feet workers
newbalance Best shoe I have ever bought so comfortable
newbalance The blue and white pair are not that weird velvety feel. These are like normal leather shoes.
"newbalance Fits fine, soft insole but will probably need to be replaced within a month."
newbalance Exactly what I expected. Fits just a little l√†rge<br/>. A little stiff. Needs minimal break in.
newbalance Great sneakers but had to exchange them for the next size up.
newbalance I would have bought two pairs if I know they would be so good.
"newbalance These newbalance are comfortable and fit great. The width is solid and true to size. Cushioning is excellent and walking in them makes me realize how worn and done my old shoes were. if your feet are extra wide like mine, go a half size bigger for total comfort. Overall not disappointed, good shoe."
newbalance Nice shoes
newbalance Nice shoes look great. The shoes came with a gel sole inserts that makes the shoes very comfortable to wear.
newbalance Good shoes. Fair price.
newbalance Love it
newbalance Ordered these for my husband who has been wearing 608s for quite a long time and he needed to have them in black for work. Really glad they fit him well and he was able to wear them all day without a problem! Wooohoooo!!
newbalance Great sneakers-very comfortable. Nice looking.<br/>I like these because they are not a loud color.<br/>They have style and comfort. Thank you for making them.
newbalance my husband uses this for hiking. he loves it ! comfy!
"newbalance At first I didn't think they would fit right. I usually get a wide width, but the size 12d fit fine.<br/>I also use inserts that were made for my feet. Everything is fine.<br/>If they ever have a big sale I would probably buy another pair. I'm retired and I live on a fixed income so<br/>every dollar counts.<br/>Thanks<br/>satisfied customer"
"newbalance Perfect fit. Last time I ordered this shoe from a different company it was on back order for a month. Amazon came thru, I received the shoe within 3 days and at a far lower price. The NB MX608V4 is perfect for me to use on the concrete sales floor. Comfortable and no pain."
"newbalance I buy newbalance shoes for th EEEE width.  Comfort is good except I have flat feet and must use additional arch supports for anything I put on my feet.  Been buying newbalance 608s for several years and after installing arch supports (again, flat feet) they provide a great deal of comfort and durability.  Duration of wear is as needed but I normally do not wear shoes except for driving and going out into public (maybe why flat feet?)."
newbalance I love the shoes. They look great and feel good on my feet.
newbalance great and comfortable shoe
newbalance good for the price
"newbalance As a very happy user of the v2 and v3 versions of the 608, I am very disappointed in the v4 version.  Sole design is different with large concave area under the heel, toe box exterior is changed significantly, as has the support reinforcements on the side of the shoe, which appear to be less substantial in the new shoe.  The final killer was the move of the retaining loop for the tongue from its midway location in older versions to very near the top in the v4.  This makes the laces difficult to tighten properly when putting shoe on, and even more difficult to loosen when one is ready to remove.  Don't know why NB chose to screw up a good design, but thanks to Amazon's great return policy, these are on the way back, and I'm off to research a suitable replacement for my 608v3 shoes."
"newbalance Have worn this model of newbalance shoes for several  years. I like them, they fit well and are comfortable."
newbalance These shoes for my husband were defective. A large lump in the insole at the heel made them unusable. They were returned returned and we had to pay the shipping. What a rip. Never again.
"newbalance I've been wearing newbalance 608's for a few years not and to be honest they are hit or miss. I decided rather then picking them up from a local store I'd just order them online. I'll have to say, this one is a hitter. The only issue I have is that the toe area can fold in a bit and make it slightly uncomfortable. I've learned that if I keep my laces a bit loose it doesn't do this."
newbalance The product is as described
newbalance The sole separated from the upper part at the toe end after only wearing them a few times. Were not near as good as other NB shoes I have had.
newbalance The toe on the fight shoe was turned in. Put some shoe trees in after I use them. Nice looking she as well as comfortable in sole
newbalance Nice shoes.  Somewhat narrow.
"newbalance Great shoe, great price. Just a bit smaller/tighter than usual.."
newbalance My nephew has difficulty finding shoes in his size.  These are very nice and comfortable.
newbalance looks an feels great
"newbalance Shoes fit well, have a good base arch support and my insoles fit in nicely.<br/>I have had them for a few months and they have held up fairly well.<br/>My only complaint is that they do not breath all that well, but they do keep your foot warm and dry with wool socks."
newbalance To small insole comes out and the box was destroyed upon arrival
newbalance Not a great shoe
newbalance Sizes seem to be off. Got 10D 1st  but it was to tight. Returned for 10E but they are loose. I give up. I'll stick with buying in store or at least trying them on in store before buying online.
newbalance newbalance size 9 4E always fit my feet perfectly. Comfortable. We'll see how well they hold up. Hard to get more than 6 months out of a shoe anymore when used for light walking.
"newbalance just received yesterday, I wore today to town very light on feet and comfortable, glad I ordered size 4e and not 2e my normal width as they would<br/>have been to narrow they seem to run a little on the small side for size and width so order a size bigger than your normal, like the dark grey color<br/>I ordered look good"
newbalance My husband loves these. He had owned several pair. Very comfortable to walk in.
newbalance Very comfortable nice-looking shoe. Delivery was prompt.
"newbalance Nice feel, nice look.  Very good buy."
"newbalance My husband usually wears a 9.5 athletic shoe, but he has to get a 10 in these. This is his ""go-to"" athletic shoe though. We just ordered his 3rd pair in the past 3 years. After about a year, the oldest pair becomes his ""grass cutting shoes,"" then he orders a new pair for everyday wear."
newbalance I bought the shoes for my son. From what I could tell there good shoes. Lightweight and flexible. Fit very well. They look good. And the price was right
newbalance I have only wore these shoes a couple times but they fit great and are very comfortable.<br/>They seem to be an excellent quality shoe at a good price!
newbalance Great
newbalance exactly as a pair previously owned (previous pair lasted several years).  he loves them
newbalance As with all newbalance products it is well made and it wears well. Good shoe for those who are on their feet all day at work.
newbalance Great shoes
"newbalance Flannel lining didn't last 2 months. Too bad cuz the fit is great, the rest of shoe should last for many more months."
newbalance I've worn newbalance shoes for about a decade. These shoes were delivered Monday. Tuesday I went for a 5.5 mile walk and also I wore new socks. During my walk my feet were very comfortable and after my walk my feet were fine. I was afraid that I might need some breaking-in period. But my feet felt fine.
newbalance Fit great
newbalance Great shoes.  Very comfortable.
newbalance good fit...nice and wide at the toes
"newbalance Have to order another pair, as the uppers are separating from the lowers. However, I'm on my feet 10 hours per day 4 days a week. I've worn these at work exclusively since early 2012, so I'm figuring about 6000 hours in these shoes. I walk 3 miles per day (indoors on carpet) on my job, so that works out to about 1800 mi. Not bad for $40 !!"
"newbalance Not quite as good as the 623's but I needed a pair in my size and opted for these. The soles tend to track water and it is difficult to dry them. They seem otherwise up to the normal impressive standards I have experienced with newbalance. Maybe a 5, definitely a 4."
newbalance Only brand that fits!
newbalance I've got these before and they do last I like them. I should get close to 2 years out of them. But I use them Just For Walking
"newbalance Fits very well. It was a little tight at first, but it stretched out within a day or two. The only thing I didn't like is that it has about a 1.5"" heel, so if you're like me and used to wearing flat-heeled shoes, you'll be in for some calf pain until you adjust."
newbalance I wear nothing but these shoes.  I tease about them being old men's shoes but they are what I see on most men's fett over the age of say 45. Good value and they are one of the only tennis shoes that come in wider sizes.
newbalance My wife has worn newbalance for years and finally convinced me to try them. No regrets! From the first time I wore them I could feel the cushion and support. Even on that first day I wore them about six hours and my feet were not sore. I've since worn them a dozen or so times and can honestly say these are the best tennis shoes I've ever owned. I'm hooked on NB.
"newbalance Little bit heavier shoe than I expected, but very comfortable and well made."
newbalance Just what I expected
newbalance This shoe was purchased to replace a previous pair that have become worn out. I have yet to wear the new pair but the fit is as expected.
newbalance My hubby's favorite shoe!<br/>Good price and fast service!!
newbalance Great shoes.
newbalance Love them<br/>I have been a newbalance customer for many years. Love the removable insert so I can put my custom inserts in them. I don't have to wear the ugly diabetic shoes thanks to NB
"newbalance These shoes are high-quality and very comfortable.<br/><br/>Beware:<br/><br/> * The dark grey shoes contain a notice that the color will run and stain socks in the rain. I was not expecting this.<br/> * Having bought the very similar 609 model for over a decade, I know these shoes are unlikely to last more than a year or so."
newbalance comfy
"newbalance The quality of this shoe has declined. It does not have the same stability as earlier 608 models. I hear the shoe creaking and squeeking as I walk. It is not a well made , solid shoe. the top of the shoe is thin and non-supporting."
newbalance All I wear is NB 608 hard to find so ordered from here and they're perfect!
"newbalance These appear to be better built than ones (NB 623) I got a few years ago from Overstock. Also, they were less expensive than those found on Overstock. I'll buy again in a few years."
newbalance I buy a lot of newbalance shoes. These did not disappoint.
newbalance Perfect shoe for everyday running around! Very comfortable!
newbalance Great deal?
"newbalance I had purchased a 12.5 U.S. Earlier. That pair was too long in the toe box for me. My recent purchase is a 12 U.S. Sizing. This pair is very uncomfortable in the toe box with some pinching in that area. Unfortunately, I will have to reorder a 12.5. I the future my priority will be to purchase 12.5 s' and use insole cushions as needed. The styling of this shoe is excellent! This shoe was not as flat as I anticipated."
"newbalance My husband really likes his new walking shoes!  Fit is perfect, &amp; the grey color goes with everything from shorts to jeans!  We will purchase again."
"newbalance So far, I love these shoes. They are very comfortable and the soft gel at the bottom really help with walking. I ordered 9.5 but it seems a tiny bigger even after putting on socks. Maybe I need to tighten the shoelaces, which I hate to do in case it hurts my feet."
"newbalance these are a bit stiff for my work - i stand all day. these are great for when i am at the gym or hiking, but they aren't good for (for me) when standing for 8 hours on concrete.<br/><br/>they have held up better than i expected for the price and i will happily buy them again."
newbalance These are the only shoes my son ever wears.  We keep reordering.  They take a lot of wear and tear before giving out and have been true to size.  He finds them very comfortable and is on his feet a lot.
newbalance Love these shoes.  I have hard to fit square feet! These shoes somehow fit and are comfortable for me.
newbalance Great and fast
"newbalance Good selection fits perfect , delivered fast as it gets , way better than Zappos ..."
"newbalance I work in a nursing home, so I am on my feet all day and theses shoes provide what I need .<br/>Support cushion and just overall great shoe.<br/>Don't know about some of the bad reviews , but I can tell you , I love theses shoes and walking the hall and doing my job, this shoe is perfect.<br/>My shoe size is an 11 4e and they fit perfect."
newbalance Great fit comfortable love newbalance
"newbalance Possible knock offs?  My other newbalance fit perfectly and these are too small, too hot and too uncomfortable!"
"newbalance I'm generally 10.5 m. Never got a size bigger, I ordered 10.5m and it was to small, so I ordered 11m and it was even smaller.. I'll try now 11.5m and I'll c what is gone be."
newbalance Very nice! Would buy again.
"newbalance This is not an athletic shoe, not even close.<br/><br/>It's a casual shoe and an average one at that. The cushioning is minimal, there's no arch support and it's stiff and rigid. It's wide enough that my arch support insole fits well, but I shouldn't have to supply one in an athletic shoe. Don't pay too much for this shoe. It's a cheap shoe. $40 is about right."
newbalance Excellent shoe. Hope newbalance makes these for a LONG time.
newbalance Had to return my original order and reorder a full size larger. Walked in them for the first time today and they were a marked improvement over my previous (not NewBalance) shoes.
newbalance new  balance for years on end only shoe i wear ...wear them 7 days a week
"newbalance Bought these at a shoe store when I needed work shoes that could handle working full time walking on concrete. They lasted most of a year, which is very respectable given the amount of wear/tear they're subjected to. Was so pleased that I went out of my way to buy these shoes again, this time from amazon. And I'll likely do it again once these wear out."
newbalance Great shoe.  Great price.  Treat yourself to a pair of these newbalance training shoes!
newbalance as advertised
newbalance Would order again
newbalance Good shoe
newbalance Great shoe. Fast shipping. Fits well.
"newbalance These are my third pair of these shoes. I spend most of my day on my feet and these are the only shoes that allow me to stop thinking about how much my feet hurt, and instead focus on my job. I buy nothing else now."
"newbalance I have used several pair of these. I walk regularly , several miles a day, and I wear the heels out. I normally keep two pair and rotate them. These have been comfortable, good support, and last well."
"newbalance Fits well in the 11 2 e for  my husband. Bought this for a factory work shoe.  He has had this style before and we will buy again as long as we don't experience the decrease in quality I've been reading about, but out of the box they seem as good as his previous version.  Time will tell and I will update with any problems that he has with these shoes."
newbalance One shoe is somewhat smaller than the other. Unusual for newbalance. Not bad enough for me to return however.
newbalance Perfect for my wide feet.
"newbalance These fit like slippers right out of the box!  No waiting to break these in.  I just got in another pair and put them right on.  I bought my last pair 9 months ago, and can still wear them but will use them for working around the house and camping."
"newbalance Not sure why the black leather doesn't separate like the brown suede does. But the other issue to be considered is how the foot bed crushes down a bit more quickly than I would prefer. Still, the only options I've found that fit and support my big square feet."
newbalance As an EMT I needed a shoe that would work well for special event standbys!  As a user of other newbalance shoes I opted to go with these and would get them again!!
newbalance Nice shoe but too tight all over in my normal size. Will return and try and larger size to see if that helps.
newbalance I love the color combination and that the shoes are leather upper. I usually buy the 608 black version for work shoes that are man made materials...the work shoes are much sturdier than the leather version? Who would have thunk?
newbalance Very comfortable sneaker. I have been buying the newbalance 608 now for a number of years. They do have a bit of a problem with durability with the soles over time. However good price for a sneaker that overall is good quality.
newbalance Great shoe for the money
newbalance just what I wanted!
newbalance I actually got these for my husband.  He told me he loved these!  He was having pain in his hip and getting these new shoes seemed to alleviate that.  The shoes seem to be well made so far and he said they fit well and feel good.  They look really good with a pair of jeans.
newbalance The gym shoes were a gift and the recipient was pleased with the fit and style.
newbalance These are the only shoes my Dad likes....I got a different style in this brand...same size and width but they hurt his feet...the toe box in this style is wider so he likes them better....he has had an issue with them coming apart though...so that is a bummer
newbalance This is my 3rd pair of these shoes<br/> They fit me beautifully and give me suppory while walking
"newbalance This is my fourth purchase of the MX608 newbalance over the past year.  Although I have more than a dozen other styles, these give me the best support for my back, given that I have significant lower lumbar problems.  I particularly enjoy the heavier than normal sole construction.  I will most definitely continue to purchase this shoe."
newbalance I have a hard time finding wide shoe sizes. newbalance is always a great choice.  These shoes look good and fit great!
newbalance they are nice shoes for the price.
newbalance Received as adveretised
newbalance These shoes look and feel great! I am very selective of my shoes as I have balance issues due to Multiple Sclerosis. These truly help in that area (without the whole orthopedic appearance) and they have a very nice casual look. Definitely worth the purchase!
"newbalance I have had the hardest time finding shoes that fit ( 10.5 and 4E ). A friend told me about newbalance shoes so I ordered a pair.<br/>Very happy with this pair of shoes, they fit perfectly !  I just ordered walking shoes from NB and hope they fit as well :)"
newbalance True to size and confortable
newbalance Nice feel
"newbalance This is my third pair of this style of NB, and I am as pleased with these as I was with the other two pair."
newbalance Will be ordering more.
"newbalance great fit, great price"
newbalance Great shoe. Reasonable price.
newbalance Great for my long walks!!!
newbalance I have worn newbalance 608s for many years.  They always seem to fit perfectly and hold up for years.  If you measure your feet according to available size and width information on the internet these will fit like gloves.  I hope these last as long as my last pair of 608s.
"newbalance Great shoes - I did not answer the ""arch support"" question because I wear orthotics and don't trust any ""built-in"" arch supports! These are good newbalance shoes that have held up well. I now have two unused pair ""in inventory"" for the future - I like them that much!"
newbalance These shoes are incredibly comfortable. I've walked for miles in them without my feet getting sore at all.
newbalance Great shoes love them
newbalance Purchasing new 'newbalance Men's training' shoes from Amazon was to replace an older pair of similar newbalance shoes that recently wore out after several years of use.  newbalance has always offered shoes in large and wide enough sizes to be very comfortable and thankfully Amazon offers the large sizes.
newbalance Very comfortable shoes that look good.
"newbalance So far, so good."
newbalance Love these shoes....have always bought newbalance but these have a cushion sole in them which adds to the comfort.....will be looking for this shoe again soon in a different color
"newbalance My husband has a hard time finding shoes that fit and that are also comfortable.<br/>He really likes his newbalance MX608V4 shoes and intends on purchasing the same model in other colors.<br/>I like the look of them, too."
newbalance They fit perfectly
"newbalance I ordered a 9 the first time, as that is my regular shoe size, but they were too small, so I exchanged them.  The 9 1/2 fits me about right."
newbalance notning to brag about
"newbalance newbalance is continually changing their product line, but these are a close match to what I have purchased before."
"newbalance So far so good, I have put about 30 miles on these just walking. No tears or falling apart like some of the reviews."
newbalance This is the fourth pair I have bought.  They fit well and I will buy more from Amazon when needed.
newbalance Great newbalance product
newbalance I've been suffering from a tailor's bunion for the last 6 months. My doctor recommended newbalance shoes. I ordered the 4E width and was astounded to find my pain completely gone after 2 days. Awesome shoes.
newbalance You will not find a better feel and this light of a shoe anywhere.
newbalance I like them there ( newbalance ) very good
newbalance Good shoes
"newbalance I've lost count of how many pairs of MX608V's I've had over the years.  I use them primarily for walking. They fit me well, they wear well, and I think they look great.  This pair is no exception.  Purchased a D instead of my usual EE and so far so good."
newbalance OK
newbalance These shoes turn out to be very supportive i have bought two pairs in the last four months- that seems to be the magic number to get new ones before you wear one pair out.  i have also purchased extra insoles only because i walk  at work mostly on cement floor for about 10 hrs.
newbalance Very pleased .
newbalance Wear a 10.5....ordered an 11D.  Should have ordered an 11.5 or an 11 wide.
newbalance Great fit and feel. I use them for my workout at the gym.
newbalance Bought a pair from the same seller 9 months ago. They last a long time. Good stuff.
newbalance My husband has trouble with fit and comfort and is really satisfied with the shoes.
"newbalance normally wear a size 8.5, but was too small, had to send back. Will order a size 9."
"newbalance Fits well, lasts as long as any of them.<br/>Still a good value."
newbalance Great
"newbalance I have been wearing newbalance shoes for many years.  Some of them have been good and some bad.  The biggest problem that I have had is the bottom of the shoes coming off and some with horrendous squeaking as I walk on a smooth surface.  I hope this pair holds up, if not, I will look for another brand and goodbye to newbalance"
"newbalance I play a lot of tennis (3.5 level).  While these are training shoes, they work great for tennis too.  Lightweight, durable, and they last quite awhile.  I live in St. George, UT where the courts are hot in the summer time.  They shoes give good protection from the heat.  I will but again."
"newbalance Great Shoe!  Comfortable right out of the box, and no problem wearing all day long.  I'm normally a white shoe kind of guy, but these shoes have some style!  Can't say anything about durability, but otherwise, happy with purchase."
"newbalance I've worn the 608 shoe for many years. This pair is the first one that feels cheap. They feel like they're made of lower quality materials. The shoes are light and great for walking, but don't feel as rugged to handle the heavy loads of a cross trainer"
"newbalance First day wearing caused a cut in the left foot just above the heel. I thought there was something sticking out from the inside of the shoe, but there wasn't. I won't wear them again until the cut is healed. The right shoe has been no problem at this point."
newbalance Perfect!
newbalance little tighter than expected
newbalance Love these shoes!
"newbalance I purchased these MX608V4 shoes 2 months and half ago. Yesterday I noticed that sole separated in the 3 places. I expected better quality from newbalance ! By the way, I found them pretty comfortable to spend all day on feet in the restaurant. But what's point if some no name brand shoes could last longer. Disappointment ;("
newbalance Great shoes.
"newbalance https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00LNOX3ZG/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br/>I had newbalance 609v2, these fit great , wear them all day with no problem."
newbalance This shoe does not have high enough uppers.  It relies on the laces to fill in the top.  Not like shoes made 5-10 years ago. I would not buy this shoe again.  newbalance has cheapened their product.
"newbalance I am very satisfied with the shoes. This is my third pair (1 white &amp; 2 Black). When I need walking shoes again, I plan to buy the same if they are still available. My wife has the same in the woman's shoe and has found them to be very good. A good product at a good price!"
newbalance Love newbalance. Fits the best. Comes in 4E.
newbalance I purchased  US size 12D . Seemed a little bit on the narrow side . Actually the right shoe seemed a hair smaller in length than the left shoe . After wearing them for a week they seemed to break-in a bit . Now they seem like a nice comfy set of shoes
newbalance One shoe fit the other was too small to wear. I'm trying shoe stretcher to fix it but have my doubts. Will never buy shoes online again.
newbalance Very convertible going to wear them as a dress shoe on a cruise
"newbalance I have been using this shoe style and brand for years. They have always proven to be a good value and consistent quality. They also do not suffer from the adolescent comic-book designs of the overpriced, over-marketed shoe sweat-shops."
newbalance So far so good.  We shall see how they hold up.
"newbalance The fit was great and they are very comfortable. I don't like the fact that all colors are made the same, but the is a considerable difference in price."
newbalance I work in a factory for 10-11 hours a day and these shoes were more comfortable than my Nike runners. I think they are a good shoe for the price but after a few months there is some wear showing. I think I could get a year out of them which is fine by me for what I paid. Also ugly as hell.
"newbalance I had some Alpines, and went to NB's... I have flat feet and am able to be on my feet all day.. They are light, perfect width, great arch support, and are extremely comfortable.. The price was excellent.."
"newbalance Pkg arrived the next day after ordering, even though regular shipping was used.  I've ordered and used the v3 version previously, since they were not available in the size I needed, I thought I'd try the v4.  The fit is the same and it feels like the v3.  Just a few slight cosmetic exterior details are different from the v3.  If they wear as well as the v3 (or even better), I'll be a happy camper.  I highly recommend these newbalance Shoes."
newbalance Comfortable shoe
newbalance Excellent.. Exactly as I expected
newbalance I moved to 9.5 2E from the 9 4E and it works well.  Overall I like the newbalance line available on Amazon a lot becaus of the wide sizes available.  newbalance seems to have pretty good QC on fit.
newbalance First correct width shoes I've ever owned.
newbalance The shoes are good at reducing my fall incidences at work but they seem to wear out quickly.
newbalance i don't care for the gel insoles that come with them.  i had to get superfeet green sole/arch supports because the arches are too flat for me and too squishy.  the shoes are great but the gel insoles i don't care for...<br/><br/>http://www.amazon.com/Superfeet-Green-Premium-Insoles-Womens/dp/B000KKTPD8
newbalance I bought these shoes for my husband. He wears an 11 wide. He loves them. They fit perfect.
"newbalance While good shoes for walking, shopping,.... They are not the best for sports, like tennis.  The gell prevents firm side to side support, as well as supported forward / back motion.  So 4 for comfort in basic use,  take off a star since can't use for what was advertised as function."
newbalance Sneakers didnt seem brand new or worth the money. Sole was already popping out and looks worn around the top. Wish i could get a refund
"newbalance This is my second pair of these. I use the original pair on a regular basis and they have become dirty from use. The second pair is for having a new, clean pair for a better appearance. Eventually, they will rotate into regular use as well and I will get another new pair!"
"newbalance Great, comfortable shoes.  My husband will only wear newbalance.  So we are always on the look out for them.  These are his favorites."
newbalance Need to return lelf big toe was cramped
newbalance I really like these shoes. They fit well and are comfortable. I bought a pair about 8 months ago and they are starting to come apart. I am not happy that the shoes don't last but I realize they get a lot of use. I usually play tennis 3 or 4 times a week.
"newbalance The first pair I ordered were a half size too small.  So I returned them for a half size larger.  Amazingly the replacements were on my doorstep by noon the next day.  I would recommend that you order up a half size.  Great shoes, comfortable, nice looking, and my feet did a ""happy dance""."
"newbalance This is a great shoe if you have neuropathy in your feet and ankles.  Excellent comfort, stability and support.  No need to spend hundreds of dollars on orthopedic shoes when these are available for $50."
"newbalance Nice shoe... But the suggested sizing is wrong. I had to send back a 9 1/2, 4E. Waiting patiently for a replacement of 10, 4E.  Hopefully they will come soon. So far no luck."
"newbalance Fit perfectly. Have had a few pair of the 608 variety, and i am glad they still make these. Usually, i find a shoe i like, and they stop making it."
newbalance I have bought these shoes from sears for years. until they stop carrying theme in our local store. I have never had any problem with these shoes. This is the first time i have ever bought on line. I believe it will be my last. I'm beginning to wounder if they are a cheap copy of the real thing.
newbalance Great shoe at a great price. Super comfortable which was my top priority for my sensitive neuropathy stricken feet.
"newbalance Good shoes, but the size chart provided needs adjusting.  Shoes are not wide enough for me to wear."
newbalance I ordered them and a pair of walking shoes at the same time.  newbalance has always surpassed my expectations until I bought a pair from Joe's newbalance Clearance.  I blame the seller not the shoe even though the shoe developed a visible hole in the toe within a couple of months.
"newbalance Actual shoe size matches what's listed, and these are decent shoes. The insole is improperly cut in one of the two shoes, so it keeps slipping back,and riding up the back of my achiles as I wear it. Normally do not have this issue with newbalance."
newbalance Nice shoe
newbalance Husband lived them.
newbalance Really comfortable.
"newbalance like these shoes, comfortable, wide enough, gel like insole. I have 4 e feet, these fit comfortable. I bought a spare pair after I tired them on."
newbalance Great shoes!!
newbalance Comfortable clean looking shoe
newbalance I always buy newbalance shoes because they have consistent sizing and fit me well.  Quite comfortable and good looking.
newbalance Most comfortable shoes I've worn! I like the style. Have had a similar pair before. I wasn't sure about the heal cavity in the sole. But wow! I love the cushion and stability. I've worn newbalance over 25 years and always have been happy with them. These are by far the best. They feel absolutely GREAT!
newbalance Love newbalance...only thing I wear!! :-)
newbalance Broke them in while attending a baseball game on Father's Day. They fit great and are comfortable
"newbalance These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have had in some time, they where almost like they where already broke in. in the past I have had to use inserts to make my shoes feel comfrotable on my feet but not with these. a great walking shoe."
"newbalance I have been wearing newbalance for 40 years and these shoes are just as good or better than my 1st pair were, great product, and they fit great"
"newbalance So far I've been really happy with this pair of shoes.  They feel really comfortable,  the memory sole feels great and my feet feel fine standing for long periods of time. Great work to newbalance and I'll keep an eye on their products in the future."
newbalance Everything is on point
"newbalance I ordered 4E width shoes, when I compare them, to the last that I ordered, through Amazon, they are about 1/2 inch narrower than they others. If I wear them, for any length of time, my feet swell and hurt. The ones that I ordered before fit well and I had no problems with them at all."
newbalance Great sneakers
newbalance Love the shoes but after reading reviews I ordered a 12.5 instead of 12 because buyers said they ran small. A little bit big but I'm going to order 2 more pairs in my normal size 12. Guess you can't always believe everything you read. Thank you very much.
"newbalance Great shoe, well made and comfortable."
newbalance I ordered 1/2 size larger to ensure a comfortable fit. I should have gotten a 2E instead of a 4E as the 4E was wider then I expected. I use my own insert to provide the arch support.
newbalance Cheap and flimsy
"newbalance For me, ""all day"" means outside because I pad around the house in stocking feet. newbalance has improved their shoe, especially the inner sole. Also the MW799 is a great newbalance training shoe if you can't get these. newbalance is a great shoe at a good price because you are not  paying for the hubris of the shoe company as with some other brands."
"newbalance I have purchased newbalance 608s for years. The v4 offers the fit, feel, comfort, design and durability I have come to expect from newbalance.<br/><br/>I wear these almost daily and have had no problems. I've worn several different colors, but these black ones continue to be my favorites!"
newbalance Fits very well.
newbalance very comfortable high quality. Typical for newbalance !
newbalance I'm a big guy with big feet. It was nice to find a good sneaker that had a wide fit and color and would still meet the office requirement of our dress code. I was surprised to see our school superintendent wearing the same shoes the other day.
newbalance Fit as expected and delivered on time.
newbalance Consulted newbalance on a replacement for another newbalance model I was wearing that has been discontinued and this is the model they recommended. Fits great and very comfortable.
"newbalance Very comfortable!  I have worn this newbalance shoe model for years, and it never disappoints.  I especially like the black shoe with white soles.  Total black is so industrial looking, and all white is so 1990's.  These have a balance to make them look sporty, even though they are my every day shoes."
newbalance Shoes fit well and were comfortable but the bottoms of the shoes began to come off only a few weeks after I began wearing them.
newbalance A++
newbalance This shoe is a toe-crusher. The inside is so slick that the foot thrusts forward with each step and crams the toes together in the front.
"newbalance Good value, and really makes a difference when I run / hike.  Prevents the knee / ankle pain."
newbalance Quality seemed ok on the pair i received. But the sizing seems off. The chart said NB model would fit the same as my current shoe and size. But the 10 Med shoes were about 1/2 size too tight. The soles seemed comfortable but my toes were too jammed up so I had to return them.
newbalance Excellent shoe!  Will buy again.
newbalance Size 15 4EEEE - Great fit! Buying more!
"newbalance Great low cost cross trainer shoe at a great price.  I've been buying these 608's for years and find them comfortable, stylish, and durable."
newbalance Size 14D was too short. I'll have to return them. My big toe was up against the end of the shoe. There was another review here that said the large size fit him. I have a 14D newbalance MW748 shoe that fits fine (I just checked that again in case my feet had lengthened).<br/>A small criticism: there's a green border around the large N in the brown model that's not on the illustration and is fairly unattractive.
"newbalance I did read some comments of this product before buying it, and I saw that it usually fits smaller than expected.<br/>I bought size 14, and it fits perfect as if it were my size: 13."
"newbalance Love these shoes.  Didn't realize when I ordered they had memory foam soles.  Super comfortable, great color.  Highly recommend."
newbalance These are excellent feeling support!! Somehow they seem to be of a little lesser quality { like everything these days it seems } but overall I would buy them again!! To me newbalance always seemed to be a better fitting shoe overall. I think they perform as I would expect them to.
"newbalance Very good price, very happy with product, would definitely buy from here again!!  :)"
"newbalance I have had newbalance 608 shoes before, but these are my first v4 and they are the most comfortable yet.  They look good and I wore them all day the first day I got them with no pain whatsoever.  Time will tell how durable they are, but I really like their looks and feel.  I have a fairly narrow foot and they fit perfectly in the standard width."
"newbalance newbalance quality has been going down over the past few years.  I've been wearing pairs like this for a while, and they seem to be wearing out quicker and quicker every time.  Also, the laces end up stretching and hanging down, and come untied randomly."
newbalance newbalance are the best choice for medical professionals to wear during long hour and extended shifts.
newbalance This is probably my husbands 4th pair of these over the years.  He loves them.
newbalance This is probably my fifth pair of similar newbalance shoes. Fits as expected and well made.
newbalance Love them! Perfect fit!
newbalance Got them for bike and beach patrol.  Only wear newbalance.  No other brand has the comfort and support they give.
newbalance Well made classic design
newbalance These are my husband's favorite shoes. I don't know what he will do when he can't get them anymore. Thanks Amazon.
newbalance Comfortable and great support.
newbalance Excellent price for the good quality.
"newbalance Had to return.  These were shoes that were returned before.  Dynamite deal but although the box had the right size, 10 4E, the shoe did not fit width wise.  I buy this show all the time so I know how it should fit.  Could not verify the size as the labels had been removed from the tongue."
"newbalance Shoes arrived when expected and fit perfectly.  It was my first time ordering 608's, but they fit just like the 623/624 series. I have found newbalance to be the best manufacturer (i.e. most comfortable) of running/walking shoes for wide feet like mine."
newbalance ok for the money.
newbalance Bought them to go on vacation to Universal Studios. Fit well and stayed relatively comfortable for the whole day.
"newbalance I don't understand, I bought the same shoe in white and black, the white fits fine but the black are to small  :("
"newbalance Comfortable, perfect fit. Good price, only time will tell how well they hold up."
"newbalance The size fits right for my son, however, compare to the NB 3000v3 the style is little bit seems too bulky which makes his feet look bigger. Hope they will create a new design to make it better."
newbalance As Expected
newbalance Great love them
newbalance As described no problems. Thank you.
newbalance Very comfortable
newbalance My husband had the identical shoe and I ordered the very same size. Unfortunately his toe was too close to the end. I needed a half size larger but of course that was not available. These shoes are from Indonesia and size is slightly off.
"newbalance I work 16 hour days on my feet. I was wearing Nike running shoes and coming home every day in agony. After getting these, that dramatically dropped to a minor ache. They come with comfort inserts that I just love. I highly recommend them."
"newbalance I all ways bought 608 or better the 623's...I was thrilled when these arrived, but when I tried them on...what a disappointment.  I wear a size 12.5 4E in NB brand, but these are so Narrow...must be marked wrong, made wrong, quality standards has gone or something.  Very disappointed.  Returning."
newbalance Great fit.
newbalance Good shoes
newbalance About the only brand I trust.  Great shoes.
"newbalance The shoes fit like a glove, snugly hugging my feet."
newbalance I bought this v4 after having owned the v3. The v3 was much better looking. It had a darker and softer suede. The tradeoff with the better looking v3 was that the soft suede ripped where it met the sole within a couple months...and that while wearing only on weekends. This v4 has a tougher leather and hopefully will hold up.
"newbalance I have worn newbalance for years.after being told by the navy doctor i was seeing for problems a heavy guy suffers with when he takes up jogging i tried them and they never let me down rhis pare are great.they hold their spring longer.i keep rotating them thru new,older and the pare i wear in the house lol.try them you will.like them"
newbalance Most comfortable shoe I have tried.
"newbalance I buy them and wear them for 6 months and by that time the shoes break down, but are not worn out and I buy more.  wish they would hold up longer but they don't.  Most of those that I know that buy them experience the same problem.  Marv"
newbalance I've worn 608's for years and the new 608V4 are even softer to walk on then previous versions which is great for my lower back.  I did experience a size difference from the 608V3 to the 608V4.  I wore size 9 with the 608V3 and had to go to size 9.5 with the 608V4.  My foot measures just a hair over 9.5 on the measuring tool.
newbalance Perfect for my foot !
newbalance These are great. Best shoe I've found for exercise walking.
"newbalance Good fit, width, good looks, terrible insoles. Be aware that the insoles will need replacing."
newbalance Great product and such a nice fit.
newbalance I wore 10.5D all my life but found they were becoming too short.  My latest order was all about size.  I ordered and received one pair of size 11 D.  They fit perfectly!  So I ordered more and should receive they by the end of the week.
newbalance I have had a couple of knee replacements and I really need comfortable shoes with great support.  newbalance shoes are always the best and this pair has been an excellent shoe.  I have owned 608's before and I am always extremely happy with the shoe.  This color was perfect and the feel is great.
newbalance Nice love them
newbalance For me fit as expected.A little break- in and they wear great .Do a lot of walking. Very comfortable all day..
newbalance Love this shoe. Been wearing newbalance shoes for several years. Was able to wear these right out of the box. No break in.
"newbalance Just what I wanted. newbalance sneakers are my favorite sneakers. No damage to the sneakers. Haven't tried them on yet but, I  already  have a pair of newbalance 623 and they are the same size, width, and length. I know that I will be pleased. Thanks"
newbalance I have had newbalance shoes for many years and never had a problem until these it makes me wonder if they are knock offs because they are not normal newbalance
newbalance Shoes are great.  Just what I expected.  Good support.  Fit as expected.  True to size.
"newbalance I have been wearing mx608-v3b every day for quite some time. They are very good shoes. I haven't had these mx608-v4b long enough to truly rate them, but they appear to be still well made. Only difference I noticed is that the sole has changed."
newbalance Typical 608 - perfect for me. My favorite shoe. So easy on the feet.
"newbalance The shoes are mis-matched; the left shoe is slightly tighter and shorter than the right. The white shoes I ordered before are excellent; the grey shoes arriving today ought to have been identical to the white ones, but are not. I would like to exchange them for a matching pair. How can I do that?"
"newbalance Purchased for ""training"" but he loves the way they look so much that he refuses to treat them as gym sneakers. They're now his good sneakers that he wears everywhere. We're heavy day-to-day walkers (not athletes) and he was comfortable in these for up to a ten-mile continuous walk through the city."
newbalance Most comfortable shoes I own
"newbalance newbalance always a great shoe, these were delivered quickly and at a terrific price."
"newbalance I like that with newbalance, since I know what size my husband wears, I can buy shoes for him without having to worry about whether they will fit.  NB is consistent in the sizing and last him longer than most of the other top brands."
"newbalance I've bought Nike, Puma, Reebok etc. They always fit incorrectly  Everytime I buy newbalance I get what I ordered and they fit great."
"newbalance I had a pair of these in white for about a year and decided to try a color. They fit and feel the same the same as the others. I am very pleased with the newbalance line. I have a pair of running shoes also. For the price these blue colored shoes are a good buy, and if past proves correct they will last a good while."
"newbalance Always a great shoe, I live in them.  Can wear them all day."
"newbalance After years going back and forth between Nike, Reebok, and others, I found newbalance and they are now my shoe. Great fit, even for my wide feet  - which with other brands was always iffy, excellent ache and ankle support, and very comfortable. I have these and several other models and love all of them. I'm hooked."
"newbalance Bought these because I can generally depend on newbalance sizing. Bought them while they were ~ thirty bocaronies. I see now they are closer to ~eighty. Good deal at the former. Not so much at te latter. Support is ok, but not like a running. Just a very comfortable ( and flashy, as mine are the orange color :) sneaker."
"newbalance These are my husband's go to sneakers. He loves them so much, they're the only sneaker he buys. It was much more convenient ordering through Amazon than going to the department store. I will definitely order them this way for now on!"
"newbalance My husband always gets newbalance Cross trainers, the fit and comfort are excellent."
newbalance I wish all shoe manufactures would use the size indicator to match other manufactures. I ordered 14 WWWW. My last purchase was 14 WWWW Nike shoe which was wide enough. These NB are also labeled as 14 WWWW but are a bit narrower to make them uncomfortable after a few houres.
newbalance Great Shoes!
"newbalance I moved to a rural area where driving to a store that carried these shoes was an hour away.. Shoes fit fine, just what I needed. Didn't spend gas money getting to make the purchase. Internet shopping is the way to go out in the country."
"newbalance Good quality, hold up well. A little stiff."
newbalance light weight and durable
newbalance Great for playing tennis
newbalance This is my first newbalance cross trainers purchase and I am impressed with the very good soft comfort of the soles.  In this regards they are as good as nike air max trainers.  Slightly snug fit but they got stretched out after a couple of day wear.  Will buy this shoe again.  Very light and comfortable.
"newbalance My husband loves these sneakers! The fit is perfect,  the color goes with everything, and they clean up quick and easy!"
newbalance Excellent fit. Great comfortable shoe.
"newbalance Maybe my feet have grown since the last pair of shoes I bought, but  wearing the 10.5 D size would have been painful.. Exchanged with no issues for an 11.  Thanks, Amazon!!"
newbalance Best shoe ever! Thanks!
newbalance I ordered the shoes in 10 1/2 4E I received a size 10 4E I didn't look at the box and put the shoes on and wore them to work the next day and realize that they were too tight and looked at the box and they were at 10
newbalance NICE SHOES
newbalance great shoe
"newbalance I had another pair of 608's that are dark brown suede. I think I have found my forever shoe. These fit and wear comfortably. And there are like 20 different variations for variety. I tried ordering multiple other brands of newbalance the same width and size. However, I had to return them all (which is a great amazon policy). I sure hope newbalance keeps the 608 around for awhile."
"newbalance Wounderful! I work as a server, so I use these shoes alot alot, and by alot I mean I walk in them at least ten miles a shift, at least according to my step counter I do. And these shoes are great and provide excillent support for my feet!"
"newbalance The shoes fit as advertised, but the soles separated from the shoes after three weeks of casual wear."
newbalance not right size
newbalance newbalance are the only shoes that I can readily obtain a 4E width and the only shoes that I always can count on to fit properly.
"newbalance Hard to find 4E wide shoes in color other than white.  newbalance always has a consistent fit.  When you find the size that fits, you can be comfortable knowing that when you order that size again it will also fit."
newbalance Love these shoes. Perfect fit. I've worn various versions of the MX608 going back further then I'd like to remember. They are all leather so don't - at least in all black - they don't develop that artificial material - foot BO - smell.
"newbalance Whenever I find a pair of shoes I like, they seem to stop making them. Then it's hard to pick another. These shoes feel very comfortable on my feet. They give me enough room in my toes to wear all day without a tired foot feeling."
newbalance This is the only sneaker my dad can wear all day with good support.
"newbalance Comfortable daily wear sneaker but poor quality.  Purchased in February of this year,  wear most days for general use but have separate gym and running shoes.  Two weeks ago they just fell apart. First the rubber in the sole began to separate and then the leather in the toe just came apart.  The shoe still look good but anywhere it was glued is now quickly breaking down.  Can't really recommend them unless you are ok with a six month life cycle."
newbalance Awesome newbalance shoes. Very comfortable.
"newbalance When I first tried them on I was concerned they were too small. Except for color, they're just like my old ones that I had too tie tightly. I then loosened the laces just a bit and they are comfortable. I wore them all day on the job yesterday and they were comfortable, even at the end of the day."
"newbalance I have an identical pair that fit perfect. I am a little disappointed that the size is not the same. Also, the shoe laces are too long compared to my original pair. My other pair that I previously purchased a few months back would definitely be a 5 star rated."
"newbalance Good shoe, fits as expected."
newbalance This show gave me blisters from just mowing my yard.  Don't buy them.  Worst pair of shoes I have ever bought.
newbalance great product/
"newbalance these NB shoes fit comfortably with very little breaking in required, which is a relief for someone with very wide feet like myself.  however they do wear out faster than other less comfortable shoes that have stiffer structure. I prefer my shoes wear out rather than hurt my feet, so I will choose these again and again."
newbalance Very comfortable and they dont look like everyone elses
newbalance Good shoes.  Amazon guaranteed free shipping on return but it fit fine
newbalance what I wear
newbalance I like them they are very comfortable I REALLY HAVEN'T HAD THESE SHOES VERY LONG AND THE TOES ARE COMING APART AT THE SEAM . I HAVE WORN $19.00SHOES FOR OVER A YEAR AND NOT BE WORN OUT I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THESE SHOES FOR WHAT I PAID FOR THEM.THANK YOU C.E. WALKER
"newbalance Fit as expected. Great purchase, unique color shoes. Comfortable while walking around all day on a concrete floor"
"newbalance Inexpensive, and look it; but you don't buy these to make a fashion statement. Comfortable. Durability is unknown, but in my experience newbalance hold together. You end up tossing them because they become unpresentable, not because they come apart."
"newbalance Item is as I have come to expect from newbalance, a shoe that fits properly, is comfortable and looks great, plus supports my foot all day."
newbalance Best pair of shoes I purchased in a long time. Been looking for 4-E width in this type of shoe.
newbalance These shoes are comforttable and provide arch support. I will bbuy them as long as they are available.
"newbalance Fit well for daily wear and look nice.  Being that it is a little colder this time of year, these help keep my feet warm.  Come spring or summer, these my not be the right style of shoe to allow for breathing but I expect that."
"newbalance Great cushion and support. The insole pops out easily. It's annoying when you have to hold it steady whenever you take your shoes on or off, but good because you can air out the insole or easily replace with a different insole."
"newbalance Ever since tendinitis in my feet and toes, these -nb- are the only shoes that work well. Have worn them for 3 years and have never had problems. I am a tour guide and will put 500 miles on a pair in a season. Though I alternate"
"newbalance Duplicate of previous pair , EXCELLENT"
newbalance Comfortable
newbalance Seems a little narrow but maybe the foot is spreading.  May need to check another brand or a wider shoe.  Been wearing 608/609 for many years.  Don't need to wear the shoe for more than an hour or so at any time so I can not report on longer periods.
"newbalance I have a pair of these shoes and ordered a replacement in the same size...  Shoes appear to be of equal quality however, Sizes are not true to advertised.  Shoes are shorter and narrower than expected.  The label matches the old label but the size is different.<br/>Warning:  Don't wait to try things and return them... 30 day return policy..."
"newbalance Great product, great price,fast shipping."
newbalance good fit good shoe
"newbalance Great sneakers at a great price. They are really comfortable, thanks to gel insoles. At first glance I thought they are too small and there is no way they'd fit my husband's feet, but as a matter of fact he easily put them on."
newbalance Too small and very little cushioning in floor of shoe.  They are not quality of the V3 Trainer I bought some years ago!  I need to return these for a refund.  What is your procedure for returning these shoes for a cash refund?
"newbalance Tears developed in the toe area on both shoes after about two months of mere walking, I bought a second pair expecting to get better results but I didn't. A tear developed over the left shoe's toe area after about three months of mere walking. I will NOT buy these shoes again."
newbalance Second pair of these. Excellent training shoes that even work well for moderate running...
newbalance No problems with these shoes at all. They fit as expected and are comfortable enough. I only wear them to the gym and back home so they have limited use. They are a decent shoe without spending a small fortune.
newbalance After two months the souls on the shoes started coming un glued and peeled off I repaired them with super glue. I have been wearing  NB shoes for years and have never had a problem like this. I don't think the quality of these 608s is as good as in the past. I also don't know who to contact Amazon only takes returns for 30 days after the sale.
newbalance Love these shoes. Very comfortable.
newbalance Fits nice The only Thing Missing on them is some Perforation so that the Foot can  Breathe and Doesn't Sweat as much it Does.
newbalance Nice shoes very comfortable but narrow I had to get a 4e and I'm normally a 2e
"newbalance These are the most comfortable newbalance shoes I have ever owned or tried.  I travel for business and I have walked long distance in many airports across the US.  If you trust newbalance, try these!  Extremely comfortable!"
newbalance Another quality NB shoe.
newbalance All good... No problems!
newbalance I had the V3 and it was a perfect fit.  The V4 pinches my toes. The same with the 609's. Both 608 and 609 were the most comfortable sneakers until newbalance changed the measurements.  Please go back to the old styles.
"newbalance Although they started out somewhat small, a first for me on a new pair of newbalance shoes, after wearing them a couple times they fit great.  There is no where else I can pick up such a great leather shoe for the price I paid.  I will definitely look here again when purchasing athletic shoes."
newbalance Love these shoes.  Very Comfortable!!!  Highly Recommend.
newbalance Great shoes - very comfortable.
"newbalance My husband loves the feel of the shoes, I love the looks.  Well made, leather shoes  Another great product from newbalance!"
"newbalance These shoes are for my roommate, who is a food server. He works in fine-dining and once it starts getting busy, it doesn't stop for four or five hours. I have ordered these, as well as the ""Reebok Men's Work N Cushion Walking Shoes"" for him several times. A pair generally lasts about for to six months. They are excellent work shoes."
newbalance After 3 weeks of walking in them for 2 hours a day they are already wearing down in the heals.  I have been using this brand for years and never encounter this problem before.  They have always lasted a few months before showing this type of wear in their heals.  Something has changed!
"newbalance I've been wearing newbalance shoes for years, in large part because they fit my wide feet well (other brands seem to be designed to be narrow, even when you try the greater widths). I have back issues and they give me the support I need."
newbalance Love newbalance shoes.
newbalance I have wide feet and NB makes shoes that fit me.  I particularly like this model and have worn out two previous pairs of these - soles eventually came off - which may be something that NB might want to check into. I think they are great shoes and very reasonably priced.
newbalance I always go after the same shoe each time. I like the fit and like that it's a white cross trainer.
"newbalance Unfortunately I bought this for my son and they were shipped to his address very small but his wife put the tenis shoe box in the trash so there is no way on how to return them ,I ordered another pairüò≥üò¨üòèüôÑ"
"newbalance The shoes are nice, they fit well, look good, and the quality is definitely there. Within 30 seconds of putting them on though, I immediately realized I would need to buy special soles, these aren't padded at all. Rather disappointing for a $55 pair of shoes!"
"newbalance I like these sneakers, I know my size and can buy them online. I have a EE wide foot, and NB was one of the first sneakers that I know that offered wide sizes.  I  did read that the quality had dropped so I will keep a eye on how long these last."
newbalance I always buy Reebok but seemed to be going down hill in the comfort department so I wanted to try something else. Well I would say about the same as the Reebok. Little narrow in the toe area but feeling better already so pretty comfortable but I love the Rockport's so much more.
newbalance I've been buying newbalance shoes for many years.  They are a good quality shoe that is available in the wide widths I require.  I do always replace the factory insole with one of better arch support.
newbalance wonderful. second pair of black MX608v4 shoes.
"newbalance Normally, I wear a size 9.  There are some shoes that I need a 9 1/2.  This is one of them.  I should've ordered a half size larger, my bad.  The insoles suck, so I purchased an upgraded insert.  Good shoe shoe for the price (60% off)."
newbalance I've bought several of these shoes.  This is not a size 7.  I will never buy them again.  I have to wear two pairs of socks.  Obviously newbalance has lost its quality control.
newbalance Very comfortable sneaker. I purchased these in an attempt to lessen the pain of plantar facahitis. The memory foam has made walking my Labrador Retiever twice daily much easier to bear. I will be ordering another pair soon
newbalance I work with people with disabilities and keep hearing about newbalance from physical therapists and different types of doctors.  I've been wearing them myself now and find them very comfortable.  They come in wide sizes which is another plus.
"newbalance These were recommended to me because of my diabetes. They wear well, look good, and were reasonable in price."
"newbalance Great shoes. Fit well, are very comfortable,  and wear well in the gym. newbalance are my favorite shoes. Also this pair is a more unusual color, they are great."
newbalance I am a heavier guy.  I bought the shoe because I am back in the gym and working to lose the extra pounds.  The shoe provides excellent arch support and fit pretty well.  I can get through my workouts with no problem and no ill effects.
newbalance I have had the shoes for over a week now and have been very pleased with them. I wear them on my job and they provide very good support. They are very comfortable and cushiony. I will definitely purchase these again. I would not say they are my most favorite shoes but they are very close to that.
newbalance Great sneaker
newbalance Got these for my 83 year old NAVY veteran father. He had an old pair but wore them out. He said these feel really good on his feet. Glad I was able to find them.
newbalance Comfortable from the start!
"newbalance great fit, love the foam inner sole"
"newbalance My third pair, good quality product"
"newbalance I have had just over a year and the sole has separated from the shoe. Have glued it back together, but that is really temporary - will buy a new pair of shoes, but will not be newbalance.  Very cheap quality, much different that previous NB shoes I have purchased."
newbalance Nice sneakers for the price. I like the style and colors. Fit as expected. I have bought newbalance shoes for years and never had a problem with them. This was my first online shoe purchase and shipping was reasonable.
newbalance Excellent shoe very comfortable and I have foot issue. I'll buy iybagain
newbalance my 13th pair of newbalance and quite possibly the most comfortable this side of my $150 1540's. i bought these at the time for under $50 and for that money they cannot be beaten. I have troubled feet and am in pain pretty much all the time when walking but these are the only shoes that alleviate the pain to the point where i can walk for several hours straight.
newbalance Size 14 wasn't even close to a size 14. Had to return.  I'm know my shoe size. Try ordering a size bigger.
newbalance great shoes
newbalance Great shoe!
newbalance The quality of the sneakers is not the quality that it was before  . I will not be purchasing them again . They were a good quality WHAT HAPPENED
newbalance I buy these shoes all the time. First time on Amazon for this product. Price point was lower here than at the store so that's why I bought them here plus I knew they would fit correctly since I have had this model before. I usually don't buy shoes online because of the fit issue.
newbalance Great price for a newbalance product in a hard to find size!
newbalance The shoes fit well and no surface flaws or defects noted while wearing.
newbalance My husband loves his new sneakers
newbalance I love them they are very lite I didn't anticipate that but love that about them too. So many times you buy shoes and they feel heavy not these.
newbalance great shoe
"newbalance I have very low arches.  newbalance tennis shoes are the only brand tennis shoes I can wear because of the exceptional arch support.  I can wear these all day and my feet feel great! The item arrived when promised and looks great, too!"
newbalance Nice cross trainer that I use for a dress shoe in my clinic.
"newbalance Just what he wanted, size was perfect fit"
"newbalance Great shoe, great style very comfortable.  good for use with orthodics"
"newbalance Great shoe, great color. Got several compliments"
newbalance Very good
newbalance Awesome comfort.
newbalance didn't last long
"newbalance Perfect Boot, perfect size first time. Size runs as expected, same as a sneaker."
newbalance Wonderful fitting shoes
newbalance I've had this model of newbalance before and was very pleased with them. But the shoes seem to have fewer support in the heels which has been causing me pain. I'm not sure I would buy the shoes again
newbalance Shoes are a little big but we are keeping anyway.  Very well made and exactly the colors my son wanted.
"newbalance 2nd pair, apparently newbalance is cutting corners.  Have had several pairs the same style and size for several years without a fit problem.  Could the latest version be getting squeezed for better profit margin???"
"newbalance I'm very happy with these shoes. I have extremely wide feet, so I am limited on what I can wear. I had previously bought a pair of newbalance shoes from a shoe store that did a very thorough fitting, and the shoes cost me over $130. These fit even better than those do."
newbalance Very good shoes as I expected.
newbalance These seems tighter than usual
"newbalance I've been very pleased with newbalance products and these shoes are no exception.  I do have to augment with my own insoles to ensure proper arch support, but that would be the case with any production shoe.  They felt good as soon as I put them on.  The soles wear at a good rate and evenly, despite my tendency to pronate."
newbalance My son has a 4e foot &amp; trying to find shoes to fit just right. He said that they were comfortable &amp; do not rub. We will know more when he wears them for a time.  LOOK GREAT!  We always seem to go back to newbalance because of having the right width.
newbalance Awesome
"newbalance Shoes are great, width fantastic (this width is hard to find) My sister in England encouraged me to buy from Amazon as she had done so for a long time I am glad I Listened to her.. The delivery was amazing. Ordered Friday Pm and received Sunday a.m. We are Happy"
"newbalance Sizing is completely off. My husband has been wearing the same size in newbalance shoes for years. Suddenly, they are visibly smaller than his old pairs of shoes. The materials overall feel cheap and shoes seem more poorly constructed than they used to be. Very disappointed."
newbalance Nice shoe. Fit perfect.  good looking shoe.  Comfortable.
newbalance good work out shoes for the treadmill.
"newbalance Very comfortable shoes that came in a very wide size.  Even without insoles these are very cushiony.  I did have issues with squeaking when I first walked in them, which was surprisingly loud, but was resolved with a little baby powder."
newbalance I will buy this again
newbalance Finally found a shoe that fits my wide feet.  Love this shoe and man is it comfortable.  Tired of Nike shoes for skinny feet.  Great shoe and looks great.
"newbalance This is not fair cause I buy this same shoe time and time again because it fits, feels and wears great. I never wear them out, the wife just says you need new white shoes !! So yet another pair and the old ones get relegated to the garage or mowing.  This is an adder to previous review, got another pair, just like putting on an old friend right out of the box."
"newbalance This was the first time I actually ordered NB's online; I usually go to the store.  Was hesitant, afraid they wouldn't fit right. My worries were unfounded. They fit just like all the other NB's I have worn throughout the yrs. I ordered the same size I get at the store; no problems. Am very pleased."
newbalance I've worn many newbalance shoes but this was the first one that didn't have a removable insole. The removable ones can easily be replaced when worn so they can last longer. I will have to see how long these last.
newbalance Fit perfectly
"newbalance Once again newbalance has  (IMPROVED !) on this shoe, I wish they would stop trying to make it better ,it gets a little worse every time, making it  cheaper trying to improve the profit margin,if I could find another shoe I could wear I would in a minute, for now I'm stuck with these, I have foot problems and cant find another so far that I can tolerate"
"newbalance These seem smaller than other NB shoes, which brand I have worn for 30 years."
"newbalance Just a tad large, maybe a half size. The price was right and they are my everyday shoes, so being a tad large doesn't bother me. So far they are extremely comfortable. I wear them 9+ hrs a day and they are holding up nice."
"newbalance Arch support is good, but not as good as previous newbalance shoes used to be."
"newbalance Good shoes. The previous pair I bought were 1/2 size larger, but they've stretched a bit so I need to lace them really tightly. These are a little snug, but I expect that in a week or two they'll feel perfect without having to pull the laces all the way closed."
newbalance My husband loves these! He's been wearing NB for years. Not easy to find the wide width he needs so he bought 2 pairs. They were listed at a great price!
newbalance good quality and comfortable
newbalance seemed to be large in the heels; as I have learned over the years : wear the shoe just on the carpeted floors for awhile and see if it really fits. I always wear newbalance but not every style fits all the time.
newbalance My poor husband has a size 18 shoe. These shoes fit perfectly. He says they are the best shoe he has owned so far. He also says the comfort of the inside of the shoes are amazing! I will be ordering more for him!
newbalance the shoes are marked wrong and I need to return them please advise. I have been buying the same size for years.
newbalance Great shoes.
newbalance Sneakers fit well and are very comfortable
newbalance I wore one shoe for about 15 seconds. I need to return them for a larger size.  What's the best way to do this?
newbalance Fit well and comfortable. Second pair I have purchased.
newbalance Service and product great as always.
"newbalance Very comfortable, great for running."
"newbalance I think they were mis-labeled. They fit like 7.5 instead of 8. The insoles were too large for the shoe. The replacement pair I ordered a half size larger (8.5), and they fit a little large, which was OK with me."
newbalance This shoe fits extremely well and they feel as if I am walking on a cloud. The shoe is much better than ones I have paid 2-3 times as much. Tried the first one and immediately ordered a second pair. I love them.
"newbalance Great fit, quality product."
newbalance Great pair of sneakers!!!!!
"newbalance Has a great fit, but a little disappointed in the cushion.  No where close to the cushion of a Hoka.  Like the black...I can get away with wearing them in the office."
newbalance Great shoe!
newbalance comfortable
newbalance This is 3rd pair I have purchased. Excellent shoe and weasr extremely well.
newbalance Feels great. First day walked  our 2 mile loop. Very happy feet.
newbalance Good style and fit
newbalance Good shoes
newbalance Been buying newbalance shoes for  several years now. They are about 40% cheaper on amazon than they are locally. I wear them until they fall apart. Some last 7 months others have lasted a year or more. I wear them every day. I think they are a much better value than buying cheap ...mart shoes.
"newbalance Always enjoy great shoes from newbalance, and these are no exception.  Well made, light, comfortable, and they look great."
newbalance satisfied with the fit.  have good support to help with plantar fasciitis.
"newbalance I have purchased these before and they had good arch support.  Unfortunately that is no longer the case.  Also these used to be made in the USA but like so many other products, they are no made in some third world country..."
newbalance Feels good
newbalance Great value
"newbalance These are the only brand I can buy on line.  Once you know what size newbalance is best for you, you can safely re-order any time.  I have had both knees replaced and five back surgeries so I need supportive comfortable footware.  NB always filled the bill.  I wear these all day, every day."
newbalance I bought these shoes because they are great for my inserts that I have to use for my diabetic complications. It fits great and they are very well made. My doctor actually recommended this type of shoe and it works great especially if you have feet issues.
newbalance Great workout and walking shoes
"newbalance Seems like pretty good material, will see how long it holds up"
"newbalance I usually wear 12w to 13, these were way tight, couldn't wear,"
"newbalance I've been wearing NB for over 20 years now...Have a very wide foot, and most other sneakers just don't come as wide!<br/>Wish they had the V3's, but they didn't come in my size? My mistake with ordering a 1/2 size too Big, but still comfortable!"
newbalance These shoes are perfect for me. I have sensitive feet and there was no break-in required. I work out at a heath club daily and do a lot of walking. These are the best fitting comfortable shoes that I have. They are well designed and the quality is excellent. This is the second pair of this model shoe that I have purchased.
newbalance Thank God someone makes a good and comfortable shoe in a 2E. Why doesn't everyone? Thanks newbalance. You saved my feet.
newbalance Just what I expected. Thumbs up.
newbalance Am very happy with my new shoes.  I have a minor reservation that the laces are not as sturdy looking as I expected but I have had no problem with them.  The price was very fair so I am a satisfied customer!
newbalance These were very nice shoes at a great price. I have owned several pair of newbalance previously and sz 11 fit perfect. However my other pairs didn't have memory foam and that maybe why these were too tight.
"newbalance In my opinion these are the best running and walking shoes money can buy. another thing I like ab newbalance most of the shoe they sell are made in the USA.<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/New-Balance-Men-s-MX608V4-Training-Shoe/dp/B00IYAG7DW"">newbalance Men's MX608V4 Training Shoe</a>"
"newbalance Said shoe was white/black/red, there is no red on the shoe. It is just white and black only."
newbalance I'm going to wear Them for a while hoping they will feel better than...
"newbalance definitely not a good looking shoe,"
"newbalance Very comfortable shoe, fits as expected. Great walking shoe."
"newbalance After wearing this shoe for a couple weeks. It isn't what I expected. It may be the same model of the white shoe. But, it isn't made from the same materials. This shoe is stiff and makes your feet sore. It's a newbalance problem."
"newbalance These shoes are comfy and last a long time, even as I wear them out hard. The colors are nice, and sized as advertised."
newbalance great shoe and a super price!  fits great and looks great!  just ordered the same shoes again but with royal blue trim!
"newbalance Ordered a size 13 received a size 13, but it was really a 12.  I returned it for a refund."
"newbalance Little to no arch support or cushioning as a whole. I have had several versions of the 608, this one doesn't live up to expectations. Cannot recommend."
newbalance Well they weren't to bad for a 2012 style shoe . But I had to spend more money for insoles and this time arch supports. So I ended up paying more than I expected but they are comfortable now that I bought the arch supports and good insoles.
"newbalance Hubby loved them, nice shoes."
newbalance Like this shoe so much I bought two pair. Fit is very nice.
newbalance thanks
newbalance Thus far about the only shoes I can wear for my plantar fasciitis. I have a black and brown pair for work. They fit just fine. I do put a pair of PF inner-soles in them. I wished they lasted a little longer. I switch both pair out and the most I can get is a year.
newbalance Perfect walking shoes
newbalance I bought these for my husband. This brand always fits &amp; are comfortable.  He wears the white ones to the gym &amp; the black ones for work. He has been buying this brand for many years &amp; they always fit the same. It's nice to be able to rely on a brand.
newbalance Great fitting and great looking shoes!
newbalance Very tight in the toe box.<br/>Will be returning if possible<br/>Otherwise a quality shoe.
"newbalance The fit is a little large, but the shoes are comfortable and priced accordingly."
"newbalance Well built shoe. Very comfortable, accurate sizing and great price. All perfect!"
"newbalance I had bought a pair of these 2 years ago and they were so comfortable that I ordered a new pair online.i wear them daily,  I like the suede leather without the mesh and the price was good."
newbalance Fits
"newbalance This is a very comfortable shoe. I'm not sure how well the memory foam will work over time, so we'll see. Also, I'm not sure how the support would be for runners. I use this for every day walking around."
"newbalance Love my older NB 608 and 609 shoes, but they aren't available anymore. These newer 608s are visibly smaller for the same shoe size. My toes were pressed against the front of the shoe. Very uncomfortable."
newbalance I used to wear a shoe called Puma by Tom McCann. Those shoes had a cool Puma Head Engraved on the soul. These brown felt workout shoes are very close to those and perfect for my casual life with jeans or slacks for cruising the boulevards.
"newbalance Ordered 11 2E, my normal size.  Excellent fit, very comfortable.  Use them as XTraining shoe (mainly elliptical and stationary bike), great cushioning and lateral support.  Very pleased so far."
newbalance Product as advertised.  Fast delivery.  Thanks!
"newbalance Love these shoes. Comfortable, durable, and stylish. My second pair."
newbalance Great walking shoe.
"newbalance I'm at 6'3"" - 240lbs. - The shoes are very comfortable.  I wear them during my hour+plus of weight training, followed by a mile run on a treadmill."
newbalance I like the leather uppers much more than the mesh used on some of the other newbalance. I wasn't sure if the grey would look dorky or not when I wore them. Not to worry. They look great with bluejeans.
"newbalance I like these shoes a lot. I've owned several pairs in the past, but this pair seems a bit narrow, even for my small feet. I'm hoping they stretch out just a little and then they'll be perfect. They aren't narrow enough to go to the wide width, but maybe I should have gone up half a size."
"newbalance These shoes fit me just right, are comfortable and well made. I'm thinking of buying a second pair in another color."
newbalance Too small in the length and toe area compared to older V3 version.  Might want to order next size up for better fit.
"newbalance Excellent product! Light weight, great support, comfortable, and a great value."
"newbalance This is a great shoe for workouts.  I haven't tried all the others, but this one is doing great for me."
newbalance My long time favorite everyday shoe.
newbalance NewBalnce 608  shoes are the best fitting and comfortable shoes . I have been wearing 608's for years. A lot of room width and depth. They are qualified as a diabetic shoe now with Medicare.
newbalance I have purchased NB sneakers for most of my life because they have multiple width sizes and a reasonably priced.
"newbalance These are my go to everyday shoe.  I've owned 10+ pairs of the 608 model over the last 15 years and I see no reason to change.  There are very few choices for a 4E recreation shoe and newbalance has always had a shoe for those with wide feet.  If you need 4E, these are your shoes."
"newbalance I've been buying newbalance shoes for so long now.  The quality for price just can't be beat.  Very comfortable shoe.  Fits exactly as expected.  If you work on your feet all day, try these shoes out.  They work great for me."
"newbalance Like always, great"
"newbalance Love these, great fit and lightweight. Great replacement shoe for my old 609s."
"newbalance Great for at the gym. These are nice, light shoes. Good for walking or just wearing around."
newbalance First time ordering shoes online. I shouldn't have gone the half size up or gotten wide as they are way too big for me. All the men in my family are size 11 and up so I'm not sure what to do with them.
newbalance I recently increased the size of my newbalance shoes to size 11 because my toes were touching the end of the shoe.  Apparently my arches are breaking down allowing this to happen.  The problem persists in the new shoes.
newbalance Very good. Fast delivery. Thank you. My son is very happy with it. Light weight and comfortable. Five stars review.
"newbalance I love this particular line of newbalance sneakers, but the laces are way too long and come untied way too easily!"
"newbalance Ordered usual size, but too small! What happened to quality control???"
"newbalance This is the third pair of 608 NBs I've owned. I'm very satisfied with the way they fit, comfortable and my feet don't get tired."
"newbalance very comfortable, great cushioning."
newbalance Good shoe
newbalance Hubby loves them!
newbalance Fit like a glove.
newbalance These were to replace a pair of  608 shoes I purchased 4 years ago.The old pair was sixed 14 B.The new shoes were 14 D. They were narrower ans shorter than the 14 B shoes. That should never happen . I returned them the same days as I received them.
newbalance Good shoes a little over priced for what they are though
"newbalance For a newbalance shoe this one is a huge disappointment,  the fit is sort of ok, BUT I can't stand how much noise they make when walking,<br/>I strongly would NOT recommend this model."
newbalance Quality and quick service
newbalance I am disappointed that the shoe does not fit as well as the many other NB shoes that I own.  Too much hassle to get them replaced so I will just make do.  Next time I won't buy online.
newbalance Have worn NB shoes for years.  No longer able to get the # that I used to wear.  These are a nice replacement and fit as well as the previous ones.  They arrived sooner than I expected.  Very pleased
"newbalance I ordered my normal size, 10.5, which is what my last 2 NB 608's were.  The 608 v4 has a narrower toe area and the show was too small.  Amazon immediately shipped out a size 11 which should arrive tomorrow."
newbalance The kind of work that I do I am on my knees from time to time.  I always wear out the thread on the toes and have to keep buying new ones.  They don't last but 2 to 3 months for this reason.  They get kind of expensive after a while.
"newbalance Nice shoes. They fit as expected and were comfortable with good support. The only negative would be that they didn't breathe as well as I had hoped. Consequently, they were a bit warm and caused my feet to sweat. Other than that, highly recommended."
"newbalance IF YOU ARE EXPIERINCING A BUNION YOU KNOW  THAT IT WILL BARK AT YOU ALL DAY LONG IF YOU DONT GIVE IT SPACE.THESE SHOES GIVE IT .THESE ARE SOLID LEATHER UPPERS ,SO YOU MUST ALLOW FOR LITTLE EXPANSION. BUY THEM BIG .YOU WONT BE SORRY."
"newbalance if i reordered i would order a size larger. i wore a size 13 D for years,now a 14 D fits. however this shoe needs to be a 15 D to fit right."
newbalance I am a big guy (6'7'' and 350) and I go through shoes pretty fast. At 50.00 these last 6 months or better. They are comfortable and durable.
"newbalance I chose wide fit and they works great. Light weight, nice color and design.<br/>I am very happy with these and no complaints."
newbalance The shoe fits perfectly.
newbalance The perfect tennis shoes
newbalance very comfortable sneaker
"newbalance Husband ordered, has an older pair in white with blue leather stripes. He expected the blue would be leather but it is suede! Now when the dog steps on his foot he goes all Elvis and says ""Baby don't you step on my blue suede shoes!"" I can't stand it. The arch support is the usual (poor) he uses insoles for the correct arch support."
newbalance Not happy with fit .  All my shoes are size 10. But these donot fit .
"newbalance Not perfect, but very good--especially for the price."
"newbalance Son finds them comfortable all day, even after lots of walking."
"newbalance Despite the seemingly good reviews, the quality on these shoes is exceptionally poor, particularly in comparison to the previous models. These have started to fall apart after 2 months of light use."
"newbalance This is a good training shoe for treadmill, elliptical, power walks in the neighborhood, etc. Sustained jogging and faster workouts/runs should use a running shoe. Fits well and as expected. Not cheap, not expensive, but a pretty good value for the price."
newbalance I use orthordics and they squeak in these shoes
newbalance newbalance 608s are a good fit for me  - and it's always the same. Good size loop in the back. These brown shoes are mock-suede and have a nice casual-dress look. I would buy again.<br/>I bought them with the idea of wearing them for mowing the lawn (white shoes turn green) but the mock-suede tends to collect lawn debris.
newbalance The memory foam insoles make shoe tighter.
newbalance excellent fit and comfort as soon as you put 'em on.
newbalance newbalance are always the best.
newbalance Purchased for my husband who has terrible plantar fasciitis. He wears these with his orthotics and he says they are very comfortable. We ordered the E width so he has plenty of room for foot to move around. They are of great quality and look great as well with a nice nave suede look.
"newbalance Second color I've bought, great shoe for every day use and for exercising."
newbalance Husband really likes them
newbalance Look good feel great
newbalance Great sneakers.  Fit as expected.  Very comfortable
newbalance My husband has gene wearing these for several years. Great support and wear. He works on hys feet 12 to 14  hours per night. The Podiatrist recommended newbalance shoes when he had plantar fascitis. Love them!
newbalance Good shoes.  Too wide.
"newbalance The sides of the lacing area need to close a little closer when I tie them. There is a large gap between the 2 sides. I don't know if they aren't wide enough, but I've never had this problem before."
"newbalance The indentation on the heel makes a suction-cup ""pop"" every time I take a step on a hard smooth surface.  Tile, linoleum, doesn't matter - every single time I lift my heel, it sounds like a cartoon character has just pulled a plunger off of something."
newbalance Great shoes and awesome value. i have found that NB's  are the best shoes for me as I have wide feet. No more having to buy one to two sizes larger to accommodate the width of my feet.
newbalance Nice!
newbalance Great product
"newbalance Love them so far, will see how they are in about 6 months though. The last 2 pair I bought through Amazon looked and wore nice for about 3 months and then fell all apart. Found out then, after close inspection that the newbalance (made in America) were actually made in Indonesia!!!  Wasn't worth the money and time to send them back."
newbalance Insanely tight.  I bought them half a size larger then I normally do.  If I had bought my normal size they wouldn't fit at all.  Hoping they loosen up.
newbalance They were too small so I just ordered a 1/2 size up and they fit perfect!!
newbalance consistent good fit .
newbalance I've been wearing newbalance training sneakers exclusively for the past 20 yrs along w/ my orthotics at the recommendation of my Podiatrist.  They give me the support needed for my back and hip.
newbalance The shoe in black color is quickly noticable and the first day I wore it I got two comments. I think the important thing is that I feel comfortable when I am walking or working out in the gym and it does the job well on both fronts.
newbalance Average shoe
newbalance FANTASTIC PRODUCT!
newbalance These are to replace a set of V2's and it's obvious that quality has gone to hell. I don't expect these to last as long and therefore will probably be my last purchase of this style.
newbalance These shoes are pretty durable. After 2-3 months i recommend removing the original inner soul and inserting a Dr. Shols gel insoul i have done it with every pair of these shoes i have used for work and out of work and they really add comfort to the shoes.
newbalance I bought these because of reviews I read for addressing Planters Facitus and these shoes feel real good. No pain right from the first time it wore them.
"newbalance I have 2 pair of 608 V3's and chose the same size for this shoe, but unfortunately too small.  I was very impressed with Amazon's return policy, but just as unimpressed with newbalance changes."
newbalance Nice shoes. Fits as expected.
"newbalance Good looking, good fit at a decent price. The reason for 3.5 stars is the quality of the materials: a lot of plastic and not much leather as advertised.  I am not expecting them to last longer than the pair I bought last year witch is a lot better made and I wear every day."
newbalance Nice shoes.
newbalance Always had great luck with newbalance and the streak continues.  Great sneakers at a very reasonable price.
"newbalance I always buy NB same size. There seems a little wide, but otherwise are ok. I put an additional inner sole thing in them to make better fit. Honestly, if I'd tried them on in a store I'd probably not purchased, but since I've got them now the fit is acceptable enough to deal with and keep."
newbalance I am standard size 12 and these newbalance Training shoes fit perfectly!  Looks nice and very comfortable for walking around the streets of Beijing.
"newbalance This is my eighth pair in 4 years. They ware out every 8 months, because this are the most comfortable shoes for my wide flat feet.<br/>It would be great for me if the arch was 1/8 of an inch higher because of FLAT feet."
newbalance I guess I am satisfied for it's price.
"newbalance I have always bought these shoes in store. For the first time I bought these offline as a gift for my Father. They were shipped to me quickly, fit great, and he was very happy with the product."
newbalance These newbalance 608's are my husbands favorite sneaker. We were a little hesitant to order through the mail but they fit just like his old ones. They arrived on time and in perfect condition.
newbalance shoes fit perfectly
"newbalance I usually augment newbalance shoes with an insert to provide extra comfort and arch support.  Having said that, I love the extra-wide newbalance shoes!  This particular model has a little more ""give"" in it versus the black all-leather variant.  Very comfortable shoes."
newbalance I have worn this model from newbalance for several years now and these seem to be the same as the previous shoes.  I expect to get a lot of wear out of these shoes.  I am pleased with the service provided by Amazon.
"newbalance A favorite of mine, the fit is as expected and these are long lasting."
newbalance I really like them! They are wide enough that they don't hurt my feet! Just going to have to break them in!
newbalance Nice
newbalance Replaced a worn out pair. Fits great.
newbalance My husband wears a 14 and he says these are comfortable and fit well.  They can be worn with casual clothes and look good. They arrived within a few days and were an excellent buy!  Thank you.
"newbalance Nice shoe. Although the very flat laces can curl a bit when you tie them. I like it that the different colors have differentiated pricing. I save a bit by buying the ""unpopular"" color."
"newbalance Not like the newbalance I've been wearing for 20 years. Cheaper materials, sent back"
"newbalance I really wanted to give these shoes a 5 star rating. The fit is good and they are comfortable, with good arch support. The problem is that the sole separated from the left shoe less than three months. I won't buy another pair."
newbalance First time to order shoes on line so a lot of concern as I have a very wide foot but they turned out well.
"newbalance These are my husband ""go to"" shoes. The quality is always great! We are repeat newbalance customers. Keep up the great work."
newbalance Very Good shoes. I like them very much.  Always a risk buying shoes online.  I was satisfied.
"newbalance Great support for running, giving it my 2 week slow break in period. love it so far firm fit."
"newbalance Great shoes, love them"
"newbalance I ordered a half size bigger because my previous newbalance sneakers of three years ago fit well at size 7. But these turned out to be more true to size and I should have ordered my real size 6 1/2. But they are fine with thicker socks, so I didn't want to return them."
"newbalance These are super comfortable.  The insert is great.  Plus I really like that they are not so ""soft"" when walking.  I hate ""squishy"" running shoe types where your foot just meanders in the shoe."
"newbalance It's like walking on a mattress. I work on concrete, so these shoes are perfect."
newbalance good fit
"newbalance newbalance is one of the few companies that makes shoes wide enough for me, so I don't have much choice but to buy them... However, I do like the fact I can buy a plain black athletic shoe that's not cheap junk. These are not quite as stiff as I would have liked, but they're good."
"newbalance I only wear newbalances because of wide widths, if I can find a shoe that fits and is overall comfortable I would buy it . Not a fan on price but if I find a better priced shoe that compares I will stop buying this one"
"newbalance I've only been wearing these for a couple of weeks, but so far, so good.  If they hold up for 6 months or so, I'll be buying these on a (bi-yearly) consistent basis.  Hard to beat the price!"
newbalance Shoe fits perfectly and is exactly as wide as my husband needs. He wears them all day and his feet don't get tired. Hard to find shoes for him that are this comfortable. They keep changing the models unfortunately.
newbalance Love these newbalance Shoes they are so comfortable!!!!

newbalance Love these newbalance Shoes they are so comfortable!!!!
newbalance Very comfortable
"newbalance great product, fast shipping!  will buy again"
newbalance the shoes are no longer made in the USA so they are running smaller than before. only cost me $6 on the loss because I could not exchange them for the right size. that is more than shipping costs. What Up Amazon
"newbalance My third pair of these shoes. Very comfortable, good fit. Good support during racket games."
newbalance I take a 9.5 wide. Very hard to find in tennis sneakers so I usually wear 10s.. First sneakers that actually fit me. But THEY ARE NOT A TENNIS SHOE!!!! The large grooves on the bottom will rip up a soft court. I had to buy another type.
newbalance Good price and very fast shipping.
newbalance Pleased with the fit and the support
newbalance Pretty much what you expect from a shoe of this type. I like the less aggressive sole for in-gym training but had to take off a star for lack of heel padding. Roughness can chafe your Achilles after wearing them for too long.
newbalance i may return it
"newbalance This pair of shoes are used, The insoles are full of hair."
newbalance I ordered the same size as my current Reebok runners but the newbalance shoes are far from comfortable. Width is OK but find my toes are pinched and cramped with the length. I am unable to use my cushioned socks.<br/>Shall not be buying more or recommending this brand.
"newbalance Good looking style, memory foam inner soul feels great and a good price range."
"newbalance newbalance is the only brand athletic shoe I wear and the MX308V4 is the best model yet. I was a little concerned about the breathability of the shoe since there are few air holes on the sides, but the tongue is mostly mesh so air flow is fantastic. Great shoe."
"newbalance I like the shoes, but I've been wearing newbalance size 11 for many years so I was confident that I was ordering the right size. I had to return them and get 11.5 which now fit perfectly."
newbalance First time with this NB shoe looks cleaner longer. I keep bying them because they fit.
"newbalance I have been ordering and wearing newbalance athletic shoes for a several years now, and I find that they are always true to size and width. I recommend these athletic shoes to anyone that has a tough time because of a wide foot."
newbalance These shoes fit great and feel great and offer my feet good support--and I am a big guy. I can depend on these shoes to be consistent enough in quality and size that I can order them without worrying about trying them on first.
newbalance On the advice of a podiatrist I have been using the newbalance 608 series for years. They last and are always the same size. Highly recommend them to anyone.
"newbalance I ordered these shoes for a vacation and even though we walked miles, every step was made in comfort from the first day.  Wonderful shoes and everything I expected."
newbalance Arrived as advertised.  They fit very well.
newbalance great color and fit as expected-comfortable
"newbalance What can I say, I love these shoes. newbalance are my first choice of shoes."
newbalance Pleased nice sneak fits correctly new ballance great for wide feet
"newbalance Bought extra wide to go over son's leg/foot braces (AFO's). Removed foot bedding to allow braces a good fit. Rugged sole, stands up to dragging of foot as he does when walks. These are about his 4th or 5th pair but last under rugged use for a couple years."
"newbalance I've been wearing this brand and this model for years, and don't wear anything else EVER , Even to dress up things. Delighted to find that brown and black are available now, cuz white tennies look a little out of place with my tux !!"
"newbalance Maybe it's just me, but the toe box on these 608v4s seems a bit smaller than my older 608v3s. I've been buying the same exact size since my first 608 over 10 years ago (I think). It's still a great shoe, but be careful with the sizing. Your little piggies just might get pinched a little at their tips.Grea"
"newbalance I will only purchase newbalance athletic shoes and the 608s are my favorite. Unfortunately local shoe stores often do not offer the size and color I want, so ordering from Amazon is perfect."
"newbalance It fits beautifully.  My feet are a bit wide, and newbalance is the only brand that feels right.  The shoes are light, sturdy, and look great."
"newbalance Very comfortable shoe. If you need to be on your feet more than 8 hours and need something nice and light, this is your shoe. They do not need a breaking period, put them right on and go."
newbalance Great quality sneaker.
"newbalance The shoes were just what I expected.  I did wonder why the laces were sooooo long, but they worked good and the shoes felt fine."
newbalance Good
"newbalance The workmanship is good. I've had many pairs of NB before. All have been good. However, I wear a brace, and I do wish these were a bit wider. But all in all OK. I do it again."
newbalance Best fitting NB's I've had in a while. They need to work on consistency in their sizing.
newbalance I have wore newbalance shoes for years and always been satisfied with them.
newbalance A favorite that has classic lines and great comfort.
newbalance Right foot heal smidge loose.  Shoe laces are too long. I thought I'd try buying shoes online since I knew for sure my size was with NB. I always buy NB and never had an issue with the fit. I'm not disappointed since I can wear thicker socks and don't notice it.
newbalance My husband requests these shoes over and over. He really likes the way they feel on his feet. He would highly recommend them to friends.
newbalance Just what I needed . Have a very WIDE foot theses are excellent
newbalance Excellent work shoes that last a year of hard walking.  I love newbalance and these shoes work well in the work place as they dark brown tones work great.  This is the second time I purchased these from Amazon.
newbalance I'm taking one star off because newbalance needs to have better shoe laces. They stretch and cause your shoe to become loose on your foot. I put a pair of upgraded laces and I love these shoes!!!
newbalance Needs better arch support. I am going to have to put in extra arch support.
"newbalance The newbalance 608V4 gets a 1 star rating for more ways than one. Those reasons are;<br/>1) Sizing<br/>2) Quality of Materials Used and Workmanship<br/>3) The Foot-Last of the basic Shoe Design compared to (all) my 35 years of being (only) a NB customer.<br/>4) newbalance's lack of Customer Service Response on several occasions about this particular shoe and purchase.<br/><br/>That said; If I was to rate this purchase only on the merit of...ease of purchase, ahead of schedule delivery, ability to return the product due to the inability to wear this shoe for longer than 20min on carpet in my living room, without screaming, I would rate ""Amazon.com"" 5 Stars for their part in the business transaction. Thank You Amazon.com, as usual for stepping above and beyond the call of duty.<br/>If only newbalance approached a business practice policy that Amazon.com did, this rating would be entirely different."
newbalance I get these shoes for my son who has gout.  He has to have a comfortable shoe and loves these shoes.  We own a contracting company and he does everything from driving dump trucks to equipment and land clearing.
newbalance The name says it all. I have used others over the years but I always come back to NB .
newbalance After having surgery in February to remove a sesamoid bone these shoes are a blessing.
newbalance The sizing is so far off that I wonder if they were mislabeled.
"newbalance newbalance shoes are nice! Great quality and hold up nicely. I love to order them on amazon because they seem cheaper than in stores. With newbalance, you know you are getting a great shoe without the need to try it on (because we always get the same model number)"
"newbalance I have several pairs of the MX608V4 shoes, in a variety of colors.  I like the grey/blue for wearing with grey pants/blue jeans.  I have a lot of foot problems and these are most comfortable shoes I own.  I use OTC orthotics to get more arch support, typically powerstep or sole."
newbalance Great shoe
newbalance Nice shoe!
newbalance My husband will only wear these shoes.  Hope they never stop making them.
newbalance the width was to narrow going to return
newbalance A bit larger than previous NB purchases
newbalance very disappointed did not want the memory foam shoe but they sent it anyway
newbalance Shoes are comfortable<br/>Haven't had them long but so far they meet my expectations
"newbalance I rate this shoe perfect in every way. When Gods needs a shoe, this will be the one they buy, and they will get it a Amason in the color of their choice. You will like this shoe, I promise it feels so good too because it is all good."
newbalance Did not fit. I always wear a 9.5 and they fit. These were too tight and I sent them back for a 10. The 10 fits.
"newbalance Very comfortable shoe. I've worn this model (newbalance Men's MX608V4 CrossTrainers) before, so I was more than pleased to order a second pair. Quick turn around on shipping. Very  satisfied."
newbalance Sole pulled almost pulled completely off only 6 months old didn't abuse them just walked on the roads and sidewalks maybe a little one shoe was defective
"newbalance They felt okay at first but when I walked a mile and a half, the shoes left dime size blisters on the backs of my ankles. It's a shame too because the 'memory sole' is comfy. I'll be returning these."
newbalance Excellent I love these shoes
"newbalance After a short break in period of day or so, these newbalance became comfortable enough to wear all day. As for arch support, I always remove the supplied inserts to use my own, and so left that question blank. These work well enough for me to have purchased three pair in different colors."
newbalance good deal
"newbalance I normally wear 8.5 wide, but the ones I ordered where too small; my toe touched the front of the shoe. I sent them back and got a size 9 wide. These feel slightly large, but they're very comfortable. I've bee walking with them a lot and am very pleased with them. I'm also pleased with Amazon in accepting my return."
"newbalance Shoe size was correct' but shoes were snug...this is the second time this has happened with an online purchase...both newbalance...they fit in the store, but 2Es are never in stock."
newbalance great shoes
"newbalance I can't get NB 624's anymore they were my fav. These are narrower in the middle but have the same soft heel that I need and still have good arch support with added chiropractor insoles. The best I can get for now. No other NB has that heel. It's great, I have PF and bruised heel pads and I am on my feet all day. Love these."
"newbalance newbalance, can't go wrong"
"newbalance Comfortable so far--- I've only worn a few days, on my feet at the job."
"newbalance Ordered to be a bit bigger, fit fine."
newbalance I have bought new bal sneaks before and always get EE for larger toe box. These are wider than over the whole length of the shoe than I recall which makes them look big and clownish.
"newbalance These are very consistent.  I'll be honest, I don't understand all of the different shoe 'models'...but my feet fit, the laces tie, and I can walk and run in them.  I've had several pairs and will likely buy more in the future."
"newbalance Great fit, and good deal Second time ordering on line with no problems."
newbalance Fit was as expected and found at a great price.
"newbalance Very comfortable, good arch support."
"newbalance Not the most stylish shoes, but I use them for work and they do what I need. Typically on my feet for four or more hours and they hold up and are pretty comfortable."
newbalance No consistency in size from model to model
newbalance This is a good solid kicking around shoe and this is my third in the same family. The fit has remained over my use and they easily last several years.
"newbalance They Last All Day, but after about 10 to 15 Hours of gigging, most anybody will have sore dogs, so these make the grade."
"newbalance The sole of the shoe started coming apart after 2 weeks of wear.  I have purchased newbalance athletic shoes for several years, but the last 3 pairs of these shoes have fallen apart in a couple of months.  I would not recommend this shoe to anyone."
newbalance Great shoes fast delivery
"newbalance Great overall shoes - I use them for working all day, or walking and hiking, working outside with the older pairs.  They last a long time and are comfortable.  The only negative is they have terrible traction in wet and icy conditions."
newbalance My son has VERY wide feet.  He's 21 and struggles between getting something that fits properly and looks fashionable.<br/>These do both.  He LOVES them and said they are EXTREMELY comfortable.
newbalance they  are great
newbalance Excellent value
newbalance normally wear size 13 bumped up to a 14 and they barely fit i think down sizing is every were.
newbalance Fits great and is very comfortable . I will buy it again.
newbalance Bought these for my husband. He really likes them a lot. He needs more arch support and cushion and these shoes definitely deliver. They are true to size. He wears 11 1/2 and that's the size I ordered and they fit perfectly. Great shoes!
"newbalance I bought these for my son, newbalance has been a great brand and choice in shoes, these are good too and glad we were able to find them and ordered them.  these are not seconds, hope they last a long time."
newbalance Perfect fit.  Love these
newbalance The different types of the NB shoes do vary a little in width.  I had a regular width shoe that I had to return and then got the wider one.... this is great now!!
"newbalance I'm loyal to the newbalance brand.  I have never gotten a shoe from these people that didn't meet my expectations and have, over time a long wear life.  But, I just use them as sneakers, I never train.  If you saw me you would know."
"newbalance Great fit, super comfortable. Good for walking, standing around for a long time at a concert, or just casual wear. Highly recommended."
newbalance Big fan of newbalance. Comfortable fit.
newbalance Have purchased these shoes in the past.  This pair seems narrower than previous pairs.  Still their good shoes for the amount they cost.  I would suggest upgrading to a more aggressive style if needing a serious cross trainer.
newbalance I now own two pairs of NB MX608V4 training shoes. I bought one pair hoping they'd be ok and they turned out to be better than ok. I needed another pair of shoes a couple of months later so I bought the same thing in a different color and couldn't be happier.
"newbalance Awesome, comfortable limousine for The Feet!"
newbalance Comfortable from the 1st day.  Very pleased.
"newbalance Awesome shoes, work on concrete floor all day! I have Planters Faciatis already but am in treatment so hope these will help with that, inside additional insert helps BIG TIME!!!"
"newbalance I really like newbalance shoes.  They always meet my expectations,"
"newbalance Quality poor.  Not soft; white not sueded. I have always worn a 8 3E.  NB 8 2E are always a perfect fit.  This shoe seems too long but not wide enough.  The support is next to nothing.  You ar enot going to do any training in this shoe. All and all , forget it.  buy another"
"newbalance This newbalance shoe is very comfortable and it is great that it comes in a wide width.  My teenager wore these shoes to march in a parade and they worked great. They met the dress code requirement and were very comfortable.  I have a pair just like them in a different size, and they look nice and are comfortable."
newbalance Shoes were delivered May 22. Today is August 13. The whole sole of one shoe has come off. Too late to return them. I won't be ordering shoes again.
newbalance I am happy that I can get these shoes in the wide width that I need. I've been wearing newbalance walking ( what I used to call sneakers) since I could get wide widths and they feel comfortable.
newbalance Fit the same as prior NB 609. Better cushioning and simplified lacing system.  I love 'em.
newbalance Husband loves!!
"newbalance Best snickers I have, also it have a great durability and is a very good looking shoe. I have adidas and reebok but the fit of this one is superior to the other brands. I will recommend it without hesitation"
newbalance I love my new shoes.  They are everything I expected and more.
